Hundreds of millions of Hindu devotees have bathed in sacred waters, despite concerns over overcrowding and water pollution, as the world’s largest religious gathering wrapped up Wednesday in India’s northern state of Uttar Pradesh.




Over the last 45 days, more than 620 million people – over a third of India’s roughly 1.4 billion population - have attended the Maha Kumbh Mela, or the festival of the Sacred Pitcher, on the riverbanks in the city of Prayagraj, in a spectacle of color and expression of faith.




Followers have come to take a holy dip in the Triveni Sangam, the confluence of three holy rivers – the Ganges, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati – to purify their sins and take another step closer to “spiritual liberation.”




Every 12 years the festival carries the prefix “Maha,” which means great, as it’s the largest gathering of the Kumbh Mela that’s held every three years in one of four cities.




“It is a unique, once in a lifetime experience,” said Sushovan Sircar, 36, who works as an independent consultant in Delhi. “People from all over India are here, as I saw number plates of cars from almost every state.”

Though this year’s festivities have been marred by two separate, deadly crowd crushes, millions have turned out for the festival despite concerns of overcrowding and reports of “unsafe” levels of contamination in key bathing sites.




A report from the Central Pollution and Control Board (CPCB), part of India’s Environment Ministry, last month found high levels of coliform faecal bacteria in the Ganges and Yamuna rivers, despite the government touting sustainable initiatives and sanitation efforts.




Uttar Pradesh’s Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath denied the accuracy of the government report, insisting that the water was not just safe for bathing, but also for the Hindu ritual of drinking a handful after bathing.




Attendees often submerge themselves fully, sometimes drinking or collecting the sacred water in containers.




‘My sins are cleansed, but not my body’




Sircar, the independent consultant from Delhi, said he bathed in the water at Sangam point – the confluence of the three rivers considered to be the most auspicious place to bathe and where most people take their dip – twice last week.




“There is a concern because there is nothing I can do about the contamination in the water. In your mind you tell yourself, this part looks clean, spend a few minutes in, recite prayers and come out,” said Sircar.




“I took a shower for sins and then another shower for the contamination,” he laughed. “So you need a bath after the bath… My sins are cleansed, but not (my) body.”

Before the festival began, India’s top environmental court directed the state and federal pollution boards to ensure the river water was clean enough to drink and bathe in. It called for increasing monitoring and sample collecting of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers and ensuring that no untreated sewage or solid waste would be discharged.




But a report submitted by the federal pollution board on February 3 stated that faecal coliform levels, a key indicator of untreated sewage and faecal matter in water, were far above the safe limit set by the board of 2,500 units per 100 millilitres.




At various parts of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers around Prayagraj levels were more than 1,000 over the safe limit, according to the report.




Adityanath said his government was continually monitoring the water levels to ensure its quality.




Kumbh Mela organizers also told CNN that an “exhaustive survey” of all 81 drains that release water in the rivers was carried out ahead of the festival.




“We have ensured that the water quality has been maintained,” said Kumbh Mela officer Vivek Chaturvedi.




Aishwary Sharma, 31, a finance professional in Delhi, said he took a dip in the rivers despite knowing it could be polluted.




“I think it is quite evident that the Ganga and Yamuna are not clean rivers,” he said. “(But) there are many things that are bad for you… The air we breathe is so toxic for our health… It is just another thing that is polluted that could have a harmful impact on my health.”




For others, their faith and participating in the sacred festival was more important than their concerns.




“What (most people) are interested in is their devotion and religion and that they want to take that holy dip,” said Sunny Parasher, 34, from Panchkula in Haryana state.




“Where there is devotion, where there is religion, there is no question,” he said.




Kalpana Mishra, 55, a housewife from Prayagraj, said she would not take another holy dip after reading the pollution board’s report.




“What does being a literate person mean if you hear all this and still decide to go?” she asked.




Exposure to faecal contamination can cause water borne diseases such as typhoid, diarrhoea, cholera, gastroenteritis, E-coli, skin disease and vomiting, health experts warn.




Push to clean the rivers

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made cleaning the Ganges, India’s holiest river, a priority since first taking office in 2014 – with billions of dollars spent or pledged on sewage treatment, cleaning surface waste and afforestation in the decade since.




The Ganges, a lifeline for 400 million people who live and work along it, runs through 50 Indian cities that pump out about 3 billion liters of sewage every day – only a fraction of which is treated before it reaches the river, according to the World Bank.




The Yamuna, a tributary of the Ganges, has also for decades been plagued by the dumping of toxic chemicals and untreated sewage.




Ahead of the festival, Indian authorities touted this year’s gathering as a “Green Kumbh,” with sustainable initiatives such as a ban on single-use plastics, eco-friendly toilets, electric rickshaws and an army of 15,000 sanitation workers hired to clean up after major bathing days.




The Ministry of Culture said in January that the festival had been “meticulously planned to uphold hygiene and ecological balance” and would “set an example for future large-scale events worldwide” in environmental responsibility.




Protecting and cleaning the river was even a major theme at a conference held on the sidelines of the festival with religious and environmental leaders coming together for the first time on how religious institutions can address the climate crisis.




“If there is no water in the rivers, there is no Kumbh. We don’t consider it water, we consider it nectar,” said Indian spiritual leader Swami Chidanand Saraswati at the meeting. “If we all do not make efforts to protect it, then the next (Kumbh Mela) will be on mere sand.”

But complicating the green efforts was the enormous crowd size at this year’s Kumbh Mela, which saw 250 million more people than originally expected, according to one expert. Authorities had planned for about 400 million people to attend over the six-week gathering, with about 9 million people per day, but about 620 million people attended in total, according to government figures.




“It is a mammoth task to take care of such a crowd,” said Dr Nupur Bahadur, an associate director with The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), a research institute that looks at wastewater management, established by the Indian government.




River contamination could be better managed by adopting better on-site prevention and disinfection methods, Bahadur said.




One of them could be halting the dip after every 12 hours for one hour” and letting fresh water run through the bathing areas before “the dips can be restarted,” she said.




Bahadur said that while the festival’s “massive increase in footfall” strained its infrastructure, it has still been “the best human effort possible” in such a situation.




Prayagraj resident Mishra said she will be happy when her city gets back to normal.

Authorities say 565 million have bathed since the festival began on 13 January.




On Wednesday, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath insisted that the water was not just fit for bathing, but also safe for doing aachman - the Hindu ritual of drinking a handful after bathing.




The report said the waters at Sangam - the confluence of rivers considered holy by Hindus - in Prayagraj city had alarming levels of untreated sewage and bacteria found in human and animal excreta, making it unfit for bathing.




The chief minister of India's Uttar Pradesh state has rejected a government report that found high levels of contamination in a key bathing place at the Kumbh Mela, the world's largest gathering.




Tens of millions of people participate in the Kumbh Mela




The Kumbh Mela (also known as Mahakumbh) - is held once every 12 years.




Hindus believe that taking a dip at Sangam - the confluence of India's most sacred Ganges river with the Yamuna river and the mythical Saraswati - will cleanse them of sins, purify their soul and help them attain salvation.




The Mela, which stretches over six weeks, draws devotees from all walks of life and from all around the world. Tens of millions have been bathing in the rivers daily during the festival, which will end on 26 February.




However, health activists and environmentalists have expressed concern over the water quality of the rivers during the festival.




Before the Mela began, India's top environment court had directed the pollution control boards of the federal and state governments to monitor the water in the rivers regularly and to take adequate steps to maintain its quality.




But a report submitted by the federal government's Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) earlier this month stated that the waters of the Ganges and Yamuna had high coliform levels.




Coliform level is a key indicator of the presence of untreated sewage and faecal bacteria in water.




The report said that the coliform levels in the Ganges were 1,400 times more than the acceptable limit, and in the Yamuna river, they were 660 times more.




The CPCB analysed water samples from both the rivers on five separate days in January, but the coliform levels never met standards, the report added.




Chief Minister Adityanath, however, insisted that his government was continuously monitoring water in the rivers to maintain its quality.




""All the pipes and the drains in and around Sangam have been taped and the water is being released only after purification,"" he said.




""The reasons for increased faecal coliform can be several, such as sewage leakage and animal waste, but the amount of faecal coliform in Prayagraj is as per the standards,"" he added.




He accused the opposition of running a ""false campaign"" to defame the Kumbh Mela.




This is not the first time that the Uttar Pradesh government has come under scrutiny for the way it has organised and is managing the Kumbh Mela.




On one of the most auspicious bathing days in January, at least 30 people died in a crush that took place near the Sangam.




On Sunday, another crush at the New Delhi Railway Station - where thousands of devotees had gathered to board trains for Prayagraj - killed around 18 people.",International,BBC,"No faecal bacteria in Kumbh Mela river waters, says minister Authorities say 565 million have bathed since the festival began on 13 January.

The government estimates that the footfall in the 44-day long pilgrimage would be around 450 million.




Managing such a massive human gathering due to religious devotion is a formidable challenge, but an even greater challenge will be cleaning the river to accommodate such a large population.




The process to reduce the biological and chemical pollution in the Ganga river has already begun. However, there is concern among devotees about whether they will be able to take the holy dip in clean water during this grand event.




According to Rajeev Ranjan Mishra, the former Director-General of the National Mission for Clean Ganga, a river that has improved water flow naturally tends to become much cleaner.




“However, for a river to remain clean and healthy, it’s essential to address chemical pollution, preserve biodiversity, and ensure the efficient operation of machinery that treats discharged water,” he said.




According to a government affidavit, around five million pilgrims, or ‘Kalpvasis’, will permanently reside in the mela area this time. Such a vast agglomeration of people is actually 20 times the population of Prayagraj.




During this grand event, there will be four main bathing days, each with a possible gathering of 50 million people.




This would mean that on a day when 50 million people are present, approximately 16.44 million litres of sewage will be generated. In other words, the sewage generated during the mela will be additional to the daily sewage of the city.




According to an official statement given by the Uttar Pradesh government to the National Green Tribunal (NGT), about 471.93 million litres per day (MLD) of sewage is generated in Prayagraj daily.




Until November, this sewage was not being managed properly, and about 128 MLD of untreated sewage was being directly discharged into the Ganga. However, as the Maha Kumbh approached, after NGT’s strict orders, the government has now promised to treat a significant portion of this sewage.




Ground reality




In the latest affidavit submitted by the Uttar Pradesh government to the NGT in December, it was stated that out of the total 471.92 MLD sewage, a large portion of 293 MLD flows into 81 drains connected to the Ganga and Yamuna rivers, while the remaining 178.31 MLD flows into the sewage network, which is connected to 10 sewage treatment plants (STPs) with a maximum capacity of 390 MLD.




A total of 37 of the 81 drains are already connected to the STPs, treating 216.17 MLD of sewage. The remaining 44 drains, which receive 77.42 MLD sewage, are yet to be treated, though a commitment has been made to address this issue.




The government has stated that the additional sewage generated during the Kumbh will increase by 10 per cent, meaning the 216.17 MLD sewage in the 81 drains will rise to 237 MLD, which will also be diverted to the STPs.




The 178.31 MLD already entering the STPs will increase by nine per cent during the Kumbh.




However, the total sewage from the network and drains will exceed the STPs’ capacity by 43 MLD, and it is uncertain how this 43 MLD will be treated.




As for the 44 drains that remain untapped, they account for 77.42 MLD of sewage. The government claims that 60.80 MLD of sewage from 22 drains will be treated on-site, while the remaining 15.23 MLD from 17 drains will soon be connected to STPs.




During the Kumbh, sewage from these 44 drains will increase by 10 per cent, totaling 85.16 MLD, and the government has not clarified how the treatment for the additional nine MLD will be handled.




Promise of on-site sewage treatment




The government claims that 87 per cent of the sewage will be treated at existing STPs, with 13 per cent treated on-site.




However, sewage management still remains a major challenge. Statistics suggest that if the government does not convert its promises into action, over 50 MLD of untreated sewage will flow into the Ganga daily, forcing devotees to take a dip in contaminated water.




Another crucial issue is that the river’s flow must be improved for it to clean itself. Without proper biological oxygen demand (BOD), dissolved oxygen (DO), and fecal coliform levels, the desired results will not be achieved.




During the Kumbh, more water is discharged from various barrages to increase the river’s water level. Even reserve water used for agriculture is being diverted. According to media reports, from December 15, the Tehri Dam started releasing 2,000 cusecs of water daily into the Ganga to increase its water level.




Additionally, since December 24 , 5,000 cusecs of water have been released from the Narora Barrage towards Prayagraj, and this increased water supply will continue until February 26.




Meanwhile, the Kanpur Barrage is releasing a significant amount of water into the Ganga. On December 19, 4,124 cusecs of water was released, while 5,105 cusecs was released on 18th December. On December 1, 13,865 cusecs of water was released.

Promise of on-site sewage treatment The government claims that 87 per cent of the sewage will be treated at existing STPs, with 13 per cent treated on-site. However, sewage management still remains a major challenge. Statistics suggest that if the government does not convert its promises into action, over 50 MLD of untreated sewage will flow into the Ganga daily, forcing devotees to take a dip in contaminated water. Another crucial issue is that the river’s flow must be improved for it to clean itself. Without proper biological oxygen demand (BOD), dissolved oxygen (DO), and fecal coliform levels, the desired results will not be achieved. During the Kumbh, more water is discharged from various barrages to increase the river’s water level. Even reserve water used for agriculture is being diverted. According to media reports, from December 15, the Tehri Dam started releasing 2,000 cusecs of water daily into the Ganga to increase its water level. Additionally, since December 24 , 5,000 cusecs of water have been released from the Narora Barrage towards Prayagraj, and this increased water supply will continue until February 26. Meanwhile, the Kanpur Barrage is releasing a significant amount of water into the Ganga. On December 19, 4,124 cusecs of water was released, while 5,105 cusecs was released on 18th December. On December 1, 13,865 cusecs of water was released. Improved water flow reduces pollution levels in the river. Such a process begins months in advance to ensure the success of the mega event. However, this is only a short-term solution to the river’s pollution problem.",Environment Aligned,0.4702496529,0.4163589478,0.1133913919,Critical of Government,0.4414553642,0.4454939067,0.1130507588

High levels of faecal coliform (microbes from human and animal excreta) were found in river water in which people took holy dip during the Maha Kumbh, according to a report submitted to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) by the CPCB. Over 55 crore people have visited the Maha Kumbh.




In the 24 days between January 12 and February 4, data was released for 13 of those days, as shown in the graphics below. The major bathing dates that fall in this period are January 13 (Paush Purnima), January 14 (Makar Sankrati), January 29 (Mauni Amavasya) and February 3 (Basant Panchnami). Data shows that the water was unfit for outdoor bathing on and around them in some of the areas where measurements were taken. However, a large number of devotees took the holy dip almost every day. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has dismissed these findings as ‘baseless allegations’ stating that, “When we make baseless allegations or spread fake videos against Sanatan Dharma, Maa Ganga, India, or the Maha Kumbh, it is like playing with the faith of these 56 crore people”.




Measurements shown in the subsequent graphics are that of the fecal coliform levels - measured in most portable number per 100 millilitres (MPN/100 mL) - and that of the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), measured in milligrams per liter (mg/L). Another CPCB report titled ‘Water Quality Assessment of Water Bodies’ mentions that for outdoor bathing, the maximum permissible limit of fecal coliform should be 2500 MPN/100mL and BOD should be 3 mg/L.




Editorial | ​Watering down: On water quality at Prayagraj




Other measurements that are taken into consideration while assessing water quality are pH levels and Dissolved Oxygen (DO) levels in water. Data from CPCB’s assessment shows that on each of the 13 days of measurement, the pH and DO levels were within the desirable limits, which are between 6.5 and 8.5 for pH levels, and over 5 (mg/L) for DO levels.




Sangam




Data released by the CPCB shows that on January 13, on the occasion of Paush Purnima, the BOD levels exceeded the maximum permissible limits and on Makar Sankrati (January 14), the fecal coliform levels were over 4 times (11,000 MPN/100mL) the permissible limits. On January 20, the measurement was 49,000 MPN/100mL, over 19 times the permissible limit.




Areas near and leading up to the Sangam




Measurements taken before and near the Sangam, on the Ganga and the Yamuna, also paint a similar picture.




Near Nagvasuki Mandir (before Shastri Bridge on the river Ganga)




Fecal coliform levels near Nagvasuki Mandir on the Ganga were unfit for bathing on 5 of the 13 days when measurements were taken. On January 15 and January 30, these levels were found to be 13,000 (over 5 times the permissible limit) and on February 4 the measurements revealed fecal coliform levels of 11,000 which is over 4 times the permissible limit.




Near Lord Curzon bridge, on Ganga




On Lord Curzon bridge, which is further upstream on the Ganga, approximately 11 kilometers from the Sangam ghat, measurements reveal that 4 out of the 13 days were unfit for bathing. On January 30, a day after Mauni Amavasya, the BOD levels were 4.2, which is 33% more than the permissible limit of 3, as shown below.




On river Yamuna, before Sangam




Water quality was unfit for bathing on 9 of the 13 days taken into account due to high fecal coliform levels, BOD, or both. On January 14 (Makar Sankrati), fecal coliform levels were 33,000 (13 times over the permissible limit).




Near Old Naini Bridge, on Yamuna




Measurements taken around Old Naini bridge on the Yamuna show a similar pattern where the river water was unfit for bathing on 9 of the 13 days taken into account, as shown below.




Places near Prayagraj




Shringverpur Ghat which is further upstream on Ganga, was contaminated beyond permissible limits on 5 of the 13 days.




Deeha Ghat on Ganga, after Sangam




After the Sangam, which is, further downstream on the Ganga, measurements around Deeha Ghat show that the water quality was deteriorated and unsuitable on 10 of 13 days, where either the fecal coliform levels, the BOD, or both, were above the permissible limits.

The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) report said the statistical analysis was necessitated because of ""variability of data"" in the samples collected from the same locations across different dates and on different locations on the same day, because of which these did not reflect the ""overall river water quality throughout the river stretch"".

The report dated February 28 and uploaded on the tribunal's website on March 7 said the board had conducted water monitoring twice a week from January 12 onwards, including on auspicious bathing days, at five locations on Ganga river and two locations on Yamuna river.




""There is a significant variability in the values on various parameters, viz pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and fecal coliform count (FC) for the samples taken from the same location on different dates. The values of the afore-mentioned parameters also vary at different locations for the samples collected on the same day,"" the report said.




The DO or the amount of oxygen in water, BOD, which measures the amount of oxygen needed to break down organic matter in water, and FC, a marker of sewage contamination, are key indicators of water quality.

The report said that an expert committee examined the issue of ""variability in data"" and said that ""the data represents a snapshot of water quality at a specific location and time and may vary significantly depending upon factors such as upstream anthropogenic activities (human actions), rate of flow, depth of sampling, time of sampling, river current and mixing of currents, sampling location and such other multiple factors"".




""As a result, these values reflect water quality parameters at the exact time and place from where these water samples were collected, and may not fully represent the overall characteristics of the river, therefore, not necessarily reflecting the overall river water quality throughout the river stretch,"" it said.




The report also said that because of the variability, a statistical analysis of water quality data of various monitoring locations for the key parameters was undertaken from January 12 to February 22 at 10 locations of ""mass bathing"" and that 20 rounds of monitoring were done.




""It is submitted that as per the above-mentioned statistical analysis, the median value (central tendency of the data) of pH, DO, BOD and FC for the monitored stretches is within the respective criteria/permissible limits,"" the report noted.




According to the report, the median value for FC was 1,400 as compared to the permissible limit of 2,500 units per 100 ml, while the DO was 8.7 vis-a-vis the stipulated norm of being greater than 5 milligram per litre, and the BOD was 2.56 against the stipulated limit of less than or equal to 3 mg per litre.

On February 17, the CPCB had informed the tribunal through a report that various locations in Prayagraj during the Maha Kumbh were not conforming to the primary water quality for bathing with respect to the level of faecal coliform.




""The river water quality was not conforming to the primary water quality for bathing with respect to faecal coliform at all the monitored locations on various occasions.




""A large number of people bathe in the river at Prayagraj during the Maha Kumbh Mela, including on auspicious bathing days, which eventually leads to an increase in faecal concentration,"" the report had said.

https://www.cseindia.org/kumbh-time-to-come-clean-4834,Kumbh: time to come clean,"Maha Kumbh in Allahabad has perhaps no parallel in terms of the sheer size of the congregation. In less than two months over 100 million people are expected to come to this city, which sees the confluence of two rivers of India—the Ganga and the Yamuna. People come to worship on the banks of the Ganga. Even as they celebrate the river it seems they don’t see the river, but only the ritual.












The fact is that this “mela” is about how the Hindu religion—and I believe all religions—is based on a deep understanding of and respect for nature’s strength. But we now worship without reason. So, people can take a dip in the polluted river but still believe that the dirt, the filth and the plastic that swims around them, will not defile the river’s properties. Our strength has become our weakness.












It is a fact today that the Ganga and the Yamuna are polluted beyond acceptable levels. But why should we be surprised. We mercilessly take clean water from our rivers and return sewage and industrial waste. In the upper reaches, the Ganga does not even flow in many stretches because we take water for generating hydropower. The tunnels for run-of-the-river projects divert the rivers and as soon as they are released, they are diverted again. The engineer-designers have no concept of ecological flow to ensure they take water for power only after the river has enough to fulfil its environmental, social and livelihood needs. Then as the Ganga and the Yamuna reach the plains, we take every drop of water for irrigation and drinking needs. We suck our rivers dry. Then as worshippers, we put plastic into the river and everything else that should not be there. We do all this and then still believe we have rivers to worship. Or we pray to a dead and dying river but pretend otherwise.












It is clear that for the occasion of Maha Kumbh the government has made huge efforts to clean the two rivers, with a little success. These steps tell us that it is possible to reduce pollution in the Ganga and all other rivers of the country. We just have to learn the art of innovative pollution management.












This is what the government has done to contain pollution, albeit temporarily. First, more water is allowed to flow in the river. This is critical because without dilution there will be no assimilative capacity in the river. Rivers without water are drains. We should remember this. It is also a fact that this “release” of additional water deprives farmers upstream of irrigation; cities and industries of water. But it is also a fact that we cannot continue to plan for rivers without water. All users must be forced to plan for water needs based on what the river can spare, not what they can snatch.












Secondly, Allahabad has built sewage treatment plants. But then it is not as if it was desperate to clean the river. Let me explain.












In all cities of India, without exception, there is a mad rush to build sewage treatment plants. But we forget that cities do not have underground sewerage systems to intercept the sewage and transport it to plants for treatment. In this way, the built plants are white elephants—call them temples of modern India—which are built but not used. In all cities built sewage treatment capacity is underutilised. But engineers and planners have the uncanny ability to make us forget these details and be happy. They assure governments that the underground network will be built and pollution will vanish.












But the network is not built. Some sewage is treated and the bulk flows into drains and into the Ganga and the Yamuna. Worse, the little sewage that is treated (at considerable expense) is then released into the same drains that carry untreated effluents. The end result is pollution. It was in mid-1980s that the government of India launched an ambitious programme to clean the Ganga. Under this programme, sewage treatment plants were built. City engineers are still catching up with building the sewerage network for the plants to work. For the Kumbh, the government has done something smart. It intercepts the untreated sewage from the open drain and conveys it to the treatment plant. Simple.












Thirdly, the city is trying to experiment with “affordable” ways of treating sewage—by using bio-remediation techniques. The preliminary reports suggest that this system is working. The key is to measure its effectiveness carefully and deliberately.












Fourthly, the government has come down hard on the polluting industries—mainly tanneries and distilleries—on the banks of the river. The question is why enforcement against pollution happens only when there is a crisis; it should be happening in ordinary times.












The end result is that there is a temporary relief against pollution. Now the challenge is to keep the river clean. This will need more than government’s will. This will need a collective wish.

However, spiritual leaders in India used the festival to champion environmental sustainability.




Nearly one-third of India's 1.4 billion plus population descended on the Maha Kumbh Mela, a six-week Hindu gathering held in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.




The number of people attending exceeded all expectations, according to the state government.




""The largest human religious festival in the world has already seen over 520 million arrive, averaging over 10 million every day,"" said Uttar Pradesh Chief Secretary Manoj Kumar Singh, who oversaw earlier Kumbh preparations.




However, an event of this magnitude presents serious environmental challenges. The influx of millions of Hindu pilgrims strains local water resources and ecosystems, generates vast quantities of trash, including non-biodegradable materials, and increases pollution levels.

River pollution during Maha Kumbh Mela




Concerns remain over the Ganges River's water quality and waste management during the 45-day spiritual and cultural festival.




India's Central Pollution Control Board earlier this month reported high levels of fecal coliform at the confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers at Prayagraj, indicating sewage contamination.




""We need to protect nature as otherwise there may not be any Ganga or Yamuna left by the time the next Kumbh happens,"" Swami Mukundananda, a spiritual leader of the Jagadguru Kripalu Yog Trust, which promotes societal development, told DW.




""That is why we are reaching out to people to promote thought and awareness of waste, sanitation, environment, and hygiene management.""




Religious leaders promote climate action




Saints, spiritual and religious leaders have come together for the first time at the Kumbh to highlight how religious institutions can address the climate crisis and environmental issues.




Chief Secretary Singh pointed out that faith-based organizations are trying to promote sustainable practices driven by their core values and a sense of responsibility towards environmental stewardship.




The Faith for Earth Initiative, launched by the UN Environment Program (UNEP) in 2017, strategically engages faith-based organizations to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the 2030 agenda.




Similarly, Ethiopia's Orthodox Tewahedo Church has helped preserve forests for centuries, protecting biodiversity.




""We are also trying to reconnect people with nature with the help of religious leaders. This is a beginning and more needs to be done,"" Singh said.




Chidanand Saraswati, president of the Parmarth Niketan Ashram, based in the northern Indian city of Rishikesh, told DW that spiritual leaders can promote devotion and responsibility toward nature by bridging ancient wisdom with modern sustainability.




""If faith leaders, society and the government can join hands, we can find a solution,"" he added.




Many believe religious leaders can be powerful advocates for climate action within their communities through education and faith-based activism.




India's climate crisis intensifies




Human-induced climate change is already exacerbating extreme weather in India, including heat waves, flooding and other disasters.




Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology in Pune, said these events threaten food, water, and energy security.




""The entire region, not just India, is witnessing a clear trend in rising heat waves, floods, landslides, droughts, and cyclones,"" Koll told DW.

Chandra Bhushan, president and CEO of the International Forum for Environment, Sustainability and Technology (iFOREST), an independent research and innovation organization, said the scientific community and government officials realize their limited reach.




""Providing scientific information is not enough to reach people. They understand climate change and its effects if they can relate it to their lives, which science and government programs cannot do,"" Bhushan told DW.




He added that religious leaders can help bridge this gap, engaging communities on a spiritual and ethical level ""to promote sustainable practices and advocate for policy changes.""




In its 2022 report, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) painted a bleak picture for India, warning that it could face multiple climate change-induced disasters in the next two decades.




Religious leaders have committed to promoting eco-friendly practices among their followers.




This includes adopting renewable energy, implementing waste management strategies, and enhancing climate education programs within faith communities.

Edited by: Keith Walker",International,DW,"Hosting the world's largest religious gathering comes with big environmental challenges. However, spiritual leaders in India used the festival to champion environmental sustainability. Nearly one-third of India's 1.4 billion plus population descended on the Maha Kumbh Mela, a six-week Hindu gathering held in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. The number of people attending exceeded all expectations, according to the state government. ""The largest human religious festival in the world has already seen over 520 million arrive, averaging over 10 million every day,"" said Uttar Pradesh Chief Secretary Manoj Kumar Singh, who oversaw earlier Kumbh preparations. However, an event of this magnitude presents serious environmental challenges. The influx of millions of Hindu pilgrims strains local water resources and ecosystems, generates vast quantities of trash, including non-biodegradable materials, and increases pollution levels.

India's Central Pollution Control Board earlier this month reported high levels of fecal coliform at the confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers at Prayagraj, indicating sewage contamination. ""We need to protect nature as otherwise there may not be any Ganga or Yamuna left by the time the next Kumbh happens,"" Swami Mukundananda, a spiritual leader of the Jagadguru Kripalu Yog Trust, which promotes societal development, told DW. ""That is why we are reaching out to people to promote thought and awareness of waste, sanitation, environment, and hygiene management."" Religious leaders promote climate action Saints, spiritual and religious leaders have come together for the first time at the Kumbh to highlight how religious institutions can address the climate crisis and environmental issues. Chief Secretary Singh pointed out that faith-based organizations are trying to promote sustainable practices driven by their core values and a sense of responsibility towards environmental stewardship. The Faith for Earth Initiative, launched by the UN Environment Program (UNEP) in 2017, strategically engages faith-based organizations to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the 2030 agenda. Similarly, Ethiopia's Orthodox Tewahedo Church has helped preserve forests for centuries, protecting biodiversity. ""We are also trying to reconnect people with nature with the help of religious leaders. This is a beginning and more needs to be done,"" Singh said. Chidanand Saraswati, president of the Parmarth Niketan Ashram, based in the northern Indian city of Rishikesh, told DW that spiritual leaders can promote devotion and responsibility toward nature by bridging ancient wisdom with modern sustainability. ""If faith leaders, society and the government can join hands, we can find a solution,"" he added. Many believe religious leaders can be powerful advocates for climate action within their communities through education and faith-based activism. India's climate crisis intensifies Human-induced climate change is already exacerbating extreme weather in India, including heat waves, flooding and other disasters. Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology in Pune, said these events threaten food, water, and energy security. ""The entire region, not just India, is witnessing a clear trend in rising heat waves, floods, landslides, droughts, and cyclones,"" Koll told DW.

""Providing scientific information is not enough to reach people. They understand climate change and its effects if they can relate it to their lives, which science and government programs cannot do,"" Bhushan told DW. He added that religious leaders can help bridge this gap, engaging communities on a spiritual and ethical level ""to promote sustainable practices and advocate for policy changes."" In its 2022 report, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) painted a bleak picture for India, warning that it could face multiple climate change-induced disasters in the next two decades. Religious leaders have committed to promoting eco-friendly practices among their followers. This includes adopting renewable energy, implementing waste management strategies, and enhancing climate education programs within faith communities. ""We have made efforts to spread the word.

This is in contrast to the CPCB’s statement last month, which deemed the water quality unfit due to high levels of faecal coliform.




Data on the CPCB website, however, show that faecal coliform levels exceeded the “desired” and “maximum permissible” levels on multiple days during the Maha Kumbh.




In a report dated February 28 and uploaded on the NGT’s website on March 7, the CPCB stated that statistical analysis revealed median values of pH, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, and faecal coliform at various ghats were “within the criteria/permissible limits for bathing water”.




According to the report, the CPCB considered the “median value” of 1700 MPN/100 ml for faecal coliform from January 12 to February 22, which is below the maximum permissible level of 2500 MPN/100 ml, but exceeds the desired level of 500 MPN/100 ml.




Data on the CPCB website show that the faecal coliform levels at the Sangam were 4.4 times (11000 MPN/100 ml) and 19.6 times (49,000 MPN/100 ml) the “maximum permissible” level on January 14 and 20 respectively.




The data show that the faecal coliform level exceeded the desirable and maximum permissible limits on numerous days during the Maha Kumbh.




On how the water quality data collected from a particular point varies even during a day, the February 28 report stated, “As a result, these values reflect water quality parameters at the exact time and place from where these water samples were collected and may not fully represent the overall characteristics of the river, therefore, not necessarily reflecting the overall river water quality throughout the river stretch.”




Earlier, an NGT order dated February 17 quoted the CPCB report, which was submitted to the green court on February 3. It stated: “River water quality was not conforming with the primary water quality for bathing with reference to Faecal Coliform [FC] at all the monitored locations on various occasions. Huge number of people taking bath at Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh Mela in river, including on auspicious bathing days, eventually led to increase in faecal concentration.”




“On the perusal of the documents enclosed along with the covering letter dated January 28, 2025 sent by the in-charge of Central Laboratory, UPPCB [Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board], it is reflected that the high level of faecal and total coliform has been found in various locations,” the order read.




As the court’s observations made headlines and under attack from Opposition parties, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on February 19 claimed that the water was fit for drinking.




“Issues have been raised about the quality of the water there (Sangam). Water there is released after purification... It signifies that the Sangam water is suitable not just for bathing but also for aachman [a holy dip in which devotees also sip the water],” Mr. Adityanath had said in the Assembly on February 19.",Indian,The Hindu,"The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has informed the National Green Tribunal (NGT) that the water at the Sangam during the Maha Kumbh in Prayagraj was fit for bathing after taking the “median” value of faecal coliform (microbes from human and animal excreta) at the confluence into consideration.

On February 17, 2025, the principal bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) issued stern remarks, reprimanding the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB).




""You have made 500 million people bathe in polluted sewage water, water that was not fit for bathing, and people had to drink that water,"" the bench said.




The bench, headed by Justice Prakash Srivastava, also criticised UPPCB for failing to submit a comprehensive report.




""It seems you are under some kind of pressure,"" the bench noted.




The NGT bench further questioned as to why no significant action was taken to address pollution in the river before the start of the fair. It was clearly visible that sewage was directly flowing into the rivers.




""Two weeks have passed and no concrete steps have been taken by UPPCB. This is very serious,"" referring to a report filed by the CPCB on February 3, 2025, the NGT said.




According to the CPCB’s report, the water quality at several monitoring sites was found to be sub-standard during inspections on January 12 and subsequently on Januay 23, 2025.




The data included readings from significant sites such as the Shringverpur Ghat, Lord Curzon Bridge, Shastri Bridge, Nagvasuki Temple Pontoon Bridge, Sangam, Deha Ghat, and the confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna near the Old Naini Bridge.




The report stated that, especially on the auspicious bathing days, the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) levels were found to be higher than the normal standard of three milligrams (mg) per litre at multiple locations, including Lord Curzon Bridge on January 19. A high BOD indicates a high level of pollution, as microorganisms require more oxygen to decompose the organic waste in the water.




The report also highlighted a critical issue regarding the excessively high levels of faecal coliform bacteria, which mainly come from human and animal faeces. The presence of these bacteria indicates that the water is contaminated with sewage, leading to the potential spread of waterborne diseases such as typhoid, diarrhoea, and cholera.




Despite these alarming findings, the CPCB’s report indicated that the river water at several locations was not suitable for bathing, as per primary water quality standards. The report noted that the heavy presence of faecal coliform, particularly during the large crowds bathing at the Maha Kumbh.




DTE at ground zero




A recent assessment by Down to Earth (DTE) revealed that even though the current sewage treatment plant (STP) capacities were operational, around 53 million litres per day (MLD) of untreated sewage was still being directly discharged into the Ganges.




Moreover, during the NGT hearing on February 17, 2025, the CPCB’s lawyer informed the court that all STPs were receiving sewage far beyond their capacities, making effective treatment impossible, leading to untreated sewage flowing directly into the Ganges.




During DTE's assessment, it was observed that untreated wastewater from drains was flowing directly into the Ganges at several locations. While some drains were being tapped and treated, the treatment process was either partial or ineffective.




In villages near the Ganges, treated water from STP outlets was being discharged into the river, where it was used for irrigation and religious purposes by the locals. The investigation at the Kodra STP outlet near Neewav village confirmed this.




In addition, one of the 10 STPs in Prayagraj, the Pong Ghat STP, failed to meet even the basic treatment standards. This facility is located just before the confluence of the Ganges. The NGT bench raised questions about why the stringent treatment standards set in 2019 for STPs were not implemented. However, no answer was provided by UPPCB.




The CPCB’s lawyer mentioned that all ten STPs were processing sewage far beyond their capacities, and consequently, they were unable to effectively treat the sewage, resulting in untreated sewage being discharged directly into the Ganges.

The CPCB's latest submission to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) confirms that high levels of faecal coliform (microbes from human and animal excreta) were found in the river where devotees took their holy dip. The presence of these bacteria is a clear indicator of sewage contamination, making the water unfit for bathing and exposing devotees to serious health risks, including gastrointestinal infections and skin diseases.




“River water quality was not conforming with the primary water quality for bathing with reference to Faecal Coliform [FC] at all the monitored locations on various occasions. The huge number of people taking bath at Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh Mela in the river, including on auspicious bathing days, eventually led to an increase in faecal concentration,” the CPCB report stated.




On February 4, faecal coliform levels in the Ganga reached 11,000 MPN/100ml near Shastri Bridge and 7,900 MPN/100ml at Sangam, far exceeding the recommended maximum of 2,500 MPN/100ml. The Yamuna, too, showed alarming levels of 4,900 MPN/100ml near the Old Naini Bridge before it merges with the Ganga.




The implications are grave. Contaminated water not only endangers the health of millions who take a ritual dip but also affects local communities who rely on these rivers for drinking water and irrigation. Farmers often use polluted streams for their fields, exposing themselves and consumers to waterborne diseases.




A 2004 committee set up by the Ministry of Urban Development had set a desirable faecal coliform limit at 500 MPN/100ml, with a maximum threshold of 2,500 MPN/100ml. Yet, two decades later, cities still struggle with managing sewage effectively. A report by the Centre for Science and Environment bluntly states that “not a single city in India has been able, in entirety, to deal with its sewage problem.”

The Principal Bench of the NGT, comprising Chairperson Justice Prakash Shrivastava, Judicial Member Justice Sudhir Agarwal, and Expert Member A. Senthil Vel, took cognizance of the alarming water quality report while hearing a plea regarding the deteriorating condition of the Ganga and Yamuna rivers in Prayagraj.




With more pilgrims expected to arrive in the coming weeks, experts fear the situation could worsen. “If immediate remedial measures are not taken, the risk of waterborne diseases spreading among devotees is high,” an environmental expert warned. The CPCB has urged authorities to enforce strict waste management protocols and ensure that sewage treatment plants function effectively to prevent further contamination.",Indian,India Water Portal,"Alarming Revelations by CPCB The CPCB's latest submission to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) confirms that high levels of faecal coliform (microbes from human and animal excreta) were found in the river where devotees took their holy dip. The presence of these bacteria is a clear indicator of sewage contamination, making the water unfit for bathing and exposing devotees to serious health risks, including gastrointestinal infections and skin diseases. “River water quality was not conforming with the primary water quality for bathing with reference to Faecal Coliform [FC] at all the monitored locations on various occasions. The huge number of people taking bath at Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh Mela in the river, including on auspicious bathing days, eventually led to an increase in faecal concentration,” the CPCB report stated. On February 4, faecal coliform levels in the Ganga reached 11,000 MPN/100ml near Shastri Bridge and 7,900 MPN/100ml at Sangam, far exceeding the recommended maximum of 2,500 MPN/100ml. The Yamuna, too, showed alarming levels of 4,900 MPN/100ml near the Old Naini Bridge before it merges with the Ganga. The implications are grave. Contaminated water not only endangers the health of millions who take a ritual dip but also affects local communities who rely on these rivers for drinking water and irrigation. Farmers often use polluted streams for their fields, exposing themselves and consumers to waterborne diseases. A 2004 committee set up by the Ministry of Urban Development had set a desirable faecal coliform limit at 500 MPN/100ml, with a maximum threshold of 2,500 MPN/100ml. Yet, two decades later, cities still struggle with managing sewage effectively. A report by the Centre for Science and Environment bluntly states that “not a single city in India has been able, in entirety, to deal with its sewage problem.” Adding to the chaos, reports of stampedes and overcrowding have marred the event, raising concerns over public safety and administrative failure.

The National Green Tribunal is hearing a petition about the quality of water in the Ganga and Yamuna rivers amid the ongoing Maha Kumbh pilgrimage. The Central Pollution Control Board submitted a report about the water contamination on February 3 to the tribunal, which took note of it in an order on February 17.




The pollution control board said in its report: “River water quality was not conforming with the primary water quality for bathing w.r.t. Fecal Coliform [FC] at all the monitored locations on various occasions. Huge number of people taking bath at Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh Mela in river including auspicious bathing days which eventually leads to increase in fecal concentration.”




Fecal coliform bacteria are microbes that typically live in the intestines of warm-blooded animals, including humans, and are found in their excreta.




The Central Pollution Control Board also told the National Green Tribunal that river water quality with respect to biochemical oxygen demand did not meet bathing criteria on January 12 and January 13 at most locations.




“…However after that organic pollution [in terms of biochemical oxygen demand] started to decrease due to freshwater intrusion at upstream locations,” the report said. “After 13th January 2025, river water quality conforming the bathing criteria w.r.t. BOD except Lord Curzon bridge on river Ganga on 19th January, 2025.”




Biochemical oxygen demand refers to the amount of oxygen that micro-organisms use to decompose organic matter in water. Low biochemical oxygen demand generally indicates purer water, while a higher figure indicates polluted water.




The National Green Tribunal on Monday noted that the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board had not yet complied with an order on December 23 to file an action taken report on steps taken to prevent water pollution. The counsel for the Uttar Pradesh government on Monday sought a day to examine reports on pollution in the Ganga and Yamuna during the Maha Kumbh, and to file a response.

120 million people travelled to Allahabad during the Maha Kumbh Mela this year to wash away their sins and attain salvation at the intersection of the Ganga, Yamuna and Saraswati rivers. The Kumbh Mela is the world’s largest religious gathering, a mass Hindu pilgrimage which takes place every three years where holy men, devotees and even foreigners gather to bathe in a sacred river. A dip in the river during Kumbh Mela promises purification. The Kumbh in Allahabad is considered by Hindu devotees to be the holiest of all the Kumbh Mela sites, and a Maha Kumbh Mela happens only once in 144 years, making this year a particularly auspicious one.




For many pilgrims, bathing during the Kumbh Mela represents the culmination of a dream. Explains one female devotee: “We came all the way for the darshan of Gangamai (Mother Ganga) and for the holy bath. The bath is one of wish fulfillment, my lifelong desire to wash away sins.”




But the water quality of the spiritually purifying holy Ganga River has deteriorated to dangerous levels, driven by population explosion along the river basin and inadequate management of industrial and agricultural growth. In addition, when religious festivals like the Kumbh Mela bring over 100 million additional people to the river, contamination due to pollution and waste is inevitable.




As a result, this year’s Kumbh Mela pilgrims were greeted in Allahabad with signs, billboards and other promotional materials introducing the concept that some religious rituals and other activities pollute the river.




These materials were designed by JHU∙CCP, in partnership with the ad agency Lowe Lintas, for the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG). NMCG is the implementing arm of the National Ganga River Basin Authority which is part of the Ministry of Environment and Forest. This initiative was funded by the Indian Ministry of the Environment and Forest as part of a project to provide communication support to the Mission for a Clean Ganga.




The project aims to strengthen awareness of how human activities can have a negative impact on the sacred river. It seeks to increase public understanding by including a broad range of stakeholders in the conversation about cleaning the Ganges River. Religious leaders, government officials, NGOs and community-based organizations and media are being engaged in the project’s activities to make clean-up efforts effective, and to ensure that behaviors change as a result.




With so many people gathering in Allahabad for the Kumbh Mela, it offered a particularly good opportunity for JHU∙CCP to begin introducing the idea that human actions impact the river.




The Kumbh pilgrims were exposed to three sets of messages on the outdoor materials: messages that established and reiterated the grandeur of the Ganges River; messages that highlighted simple actions that pollute the river; and messages that depicted individuals pledging not to pollute the Ganges.




During the Kumbh, JHU∙CCP staff informally surveyed the visitors in Allahabad. They found that the materials were generally well-received and that most people stated the take-away message to be “keep Ganga clean”. In addition, in comparison to previous pilgrimages, the grounds surrounding the Ganges were visibly cleaner and most people followed the proper methods of disposing waste.




JHU∙CCP’s campaign during the Kumbh Mela lays the groundwork for the broader activities of the project. And while much work is needed to restore the Ganges River to its original, unpolluted state, the 120 million pilgrims who attended the Kumbh, and millions of other individuals around the world, agree that this holy river is certainly worth the effort.

https://dialogue.earth/en/water/a-clean-kumbh-in-a-dirty-ganga/,A clean Kumbh in a dirty Ganga,"Gulab Chand Negi was a happy man. On a freezing February morning, he had just taken a dip at the confluence of Ganga and Yamuna in Allahabad (recently renamed Prayagraj), where millions of devout Hindus had come to wash away their sins at the Kumbh Mela — the bathing festival of Hindus and the biggest gathering of people on the planet. “The water is so clean and refreshing,” said the 68-year-old Negi. “I feel like a new man.” There were nods and smiles from his family of eight.




For the native of Pauri district in the Himalayan province of Uttarakhand that is home to the headwaters of the Ganga and Yamuna, the purity of the Ganga was never in question. But, comparing his previous visits to the bathing festival, he said, “The sangam (confluence) is especially clean this time because of the action the government is taking.”




Several other bathers at the confluence taking the holy dip at the auspicious morning of Mouni Amavasya, the high point of the Kumbh, agreed with Negi. Most of them said the water was much cleaner due to the special efforts that the government had made.




The Kumbh Mela is held by turn at Prayagraj, Haridwar, Ujjain and Nashik. Many millions gather on riverbanks to take a dip that they believe will wash away their sins. In the process, they also further pollute the rivers, which have seen seen their flows reduced drastically recent years.

Polluted rivers




Most rivers in India are incredibly filthy. A recent report by the Central Pollution Control Board showed that the number of polluted stretches in India’s rivers has increased to 351 from 301 two years ago. The number of critically polluted stretches has risen to 45 from 34, the federal pollution watchdog said.




The Ganga is fit for neither drinking nor bathing in most of its stretches (Data source: state pollution control boards)




The CPCB classifies rivers according to category of pollution, with a category of 3.1-6 mg per litre of Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) as Category 5, and the most polluted, of 30 mg per litre or greater as Category 1. In one case, the level has been measured as high as 250 mg per litre. The Ganga is considered a Category 4 river, with a BOD of 3.5-8.8 mg/litres.




So how did the Ganga run clean during the Kumbh? Reinforcing the anecdotes of salvation seekers, P.K. Agarwal, general manager of the Ganga Pollution Control Unit at Arail — a neighbourhood in Prayagraj — said not a single drop of untreated sewage was flowing into the Ganga and Yamuna following special efforts to treat the enormous amount of human waste generated by millions of pilgrims.




“We have laid sewer lines throughout the Mela grounds and have augmented our treatment capacity,” Agarwal claimed. “We are treating 99% of the sewage, which is why the rivers are so clean this time.” He attributed this achievement to the funds made available through the National Mission to Clean Ganga (NMCG) and the extra efforts by Jal Nigam, the government utility that manages water supply and sewage treatment in the city.




Agarwal however admitted that the release of extra water upstream at the Tehri dam in Uttarakhand and the temporary shuttering of heavily polluting tanneries in Kanpur have also helped keep the Ganga clean during the Kumbh Mela this year. This show of cleanliness is important to the ruling dispensations at the central and state levels led by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) because India goes to the polls soon to elect a new Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament.




Band-Aid solutions




River experts and activists say that the transformation of the Ganga and Yamuna at Prayagraj amounts to “event management,” as many experts termed it, and will unlikely be sustained over the long term. “It is an election period chimera at best. When an Ardh (half) Kumbh could be turned into a Kumbh for obvious reasons, anything and everything could be claimed. What they have done is to release 6-7,000 cusec (cubic foot per second) of water in Ganga from the Tehri dam in a period when normal flow in the river, with all dams and barrages upstream, does not exceed 1,000 cusec,” said Manoj Mishra, Convenor of the Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan (Living Yamuna Campaign). “Obviously, with good dilution water in the river, it would appear rejuvenated. But for how long?”




“These are Band-Aid solutions and temporary at best,” said river expert Himanshu Thakkar, coordinator of the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People, a non-profit. Thakkar feels that unless there is an overhaul of the governance system, such attempts at keeping the river clean will prove futile.




Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a parliamentarian from Varanasi, some 125 km downstream from Prayagraj, vowed to clean the Ganga on the bathing ghats (steps that lead to the river) of the holy city after he was elected in 2014. He launched the Namami Gange (Salutations to Ganga) programme to clean the river and its tributaries, with a huge allocation of more than INR 200 billion (USD 2.8 billion) to be spent by the end of 2019. The government also renamed the Ministry of Water Resources as the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation to indicate the seriousness of its intent.




This is not the first attempt to clean the river. In the 1980s, then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi launched the Ganga Action Plan, also from the ghats of Varanasi. Scores of sewage treatment plants (STPs) were built in the three most populous provinces along the river — Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal. However, most of them remained defunct and the population increase due to rapid urbanisation in India quickly made the STPs inadequate to deal with the flood of sewage. Although the federal government financed the plants, city corporations and municipalities operated them, and they often failed to keep the STPs running.




In 1993, under then Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao, a new batch of STPs was added not only along the Ganga but also its main tributaries such as the Yamuna, the biggest. Several thousand kilometres of sewer lines were added. In 2009, the Manmohan Singh government established the National Ganga River Basin Authority to take a more holistic approach to clean the basin and maintain free flow of the river. But the emphasis remained on building STPs.




Despite all these efforts, the Ganga is more polluted today than it was in the 1980s.




Primary pollutant




The discharge of untreated sewage into the Ganga and its tributaries is undoubtedly the primary cause of pollution. This is responsible for 80% of the pollution in the Ganga. The other 20% is industrial and agricultural waste, according to official data.




This is the main reason why building a network of efficient STPs is important, according to Vinod Tare, a professor at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur and lead author of the Ganga River Basin Management Plan. A consortium set up in 2010 by Jairam Ramesh, India’s environment minister at that time, of the seven main IITs prepared the plan that was submitted to the government of India in 2015.




The Ganga basin is one of the most densely populated areas in India. There are more than 1,500 cities and towns in the basin, out of which the major cities — Delhi, Kolkata, Meerut, Kanpur, Allahabad, Varanasi and Patna — have populations exceeding 1 million each. The mega urban agglomerations around Delhi and Kolkata are home to more than 15 million people each.




India has been urbanising at a rapid pace. In the Ganga basin cities, population increased from 75 million in 1991 to 165 in 2011, according to the Census of India. This exponential rise has led to a corresponding increase in sewage, but not in sewage treatment.




NMCG says that the 10 largest cities on the Ganga alone account for more than 80% of the nearly 3,000 million litres of sewage that is discharged into the river. This excludes New Delhi, which pours over 2,000 million litres daily (MLD) into the Yamuna. “There is absolutely no way to keep the Ganga free from pollution if we are unable to treat the enormous amount of sewage generated in the cities along its course,” Tare said.




The official estimates of sewage is much below the actual amount because more than a fourth of the urban population in India live in unauthorised slums and shantytowns that are not linked to the sewage network. The waste from these places usually flow into storm water drains and ultimately flows into the river untreated.




Not keeping pace




The installed capacity of STPs in the Ganga basin does not exceed 1,500 MLD, according to CPCB. The Namami Gange programme has sanctioned INR 247 billion (USD 3.5 billion), the government said in Parliament at the end of 2018. A lion’s share of that will be spent on treatment plants.




While there is little dispute over the importance of STPs, the government’s approach on focussing on only big STPs has been criticised by experts.




The focus of central government spending on reviving the Ganga river basin remains overwhelmingly on sewage treatment plants [Source: National Mission for Clean Ganga, December 2018]




“Our experience of trying to clean the Ganga and Yamuna for the past 30 years teaches us that the focus has to shift away from mega STPs,” said Thakkar. “Delhi has the highest STP capacity in the country. But that hasn’t stopped the Yamuna from becoming a dirty drain.”




“STPs upkeep in Delhi is a classic case of how sewerage management should not be carried out,” argued Mishra. “The government’s focus on STPs as the solution to river woes has failed repeatedly, first with Ganga Action Plan, then with Yamuna Action Plan, and shall unfortunately fail again under Namami Gange.”




The focus on large scale sewerage concentrates everything on one aspect, whereas pollution reaches the river through multiple avenues. A more decentralised structure could be more adaptive, and would focus on the source of the pollution, but this approach has not been followed.




Strong criticism




Thakkar has been a fierce critic of the Namami Gange programme of the current government. “The quality of water has deteriorated in the past four years, even in Varanasi,” he said, adding that even the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India has found serious deficiencies and shortfalls in almost every aspect of the programme.




A large portion of the funds allocated to build sewage infrastructure remains unspent [Source: National Mission for Clean Ganga, December 2018]




“(The) National Mission for Clean Ganga could not finalise the long-term action plans even after more than six and half years of signing of agreement with the consortium of Indian Institutes of Technology,” the CAG said in a 2017 report.




Ruling party politicians have not helped matters by making extravagant forecasts. “In just 10% work of the Rs 26,000 crore (USD 3.68 billion) project currently underway, the Ganga has started getting cleaner,” Water Resources Minister Nitin Gadkari was quoted as saying in a media report. “By March this year, 30-40% of the work will be completed, and by March next year, Ganga will be 100% clean.”




“Keeping a river clean is a continuous process,” said Thakkar. “How can it have an end date?” It is not just experts who understand this. “I’ve been coming to the Magh Mela for the past few years and have seen that it doesn’t matter how well it is organised,” said Chittaranjan Haldar, a sanitation worker from West Bengal deployed by a government contractor at the Prayagraj Kumbh. “You have to keep cleaning. Otherwise the filth piles up again.”




The Magh Mela is held in the winter every year at Prayagraj, which transforms into the much bigger Kumbh Mela every 12 years. An Ardh Kumbh – like the one celebrated this year – is held in every intervening sixth year.




Decentralised solution




Promoting small and decentralised STPs is a better solution to keep untreated waste from reaching the river, experts said. “A river should not be treated as the end destination of any waste or used water, be it domestic or industrial. Every city and industry must be zero discharge as far as any nearby water body or a river is considered,” said Mishra.




“Decentralised management of domestic effluent is the only answer,” says Somnath Bandyopadhyay, associate professor at the School of Ecology and Environment Studies in Nalanda University, Bihar. “Smaller, decentralised and localised solutions work better simply because they are simpler and could be adapted to the specific needs and managed better.”




The problem becomes even more intractable when it comes to industrial effluents, says Bandyopadhyay, who earlier worked for the National Ganga River Basin Authority.




“Central effluent treatment plants (CETPs) [which treat industrial waste] face a different set of challenges. It is an unknown cocktail that it has to deal with. One solution is some amount of pre-treatment and quality-based charges imposed on quantities discharged by individual factories,” Bandyopadhyay said. But transferring the liability from industries to the CETPs might work better, he added.




Bandyopadhyay’s comments point to the economic aspects of making any cleaning programme sustainable. Experts say that municipalities and city corporations need to be empowered to tax citizens to pay for waste treatment if such efforts are to be made sustainable rather than depend on government dole all the time.

Water Unfit for Bathing, Says CPCB Report




The CPCB’s report, submitted to the NGT, stated that the river water in Prayagraj does not meet the required standards for bathing. As per pollution control norms, water is considered safe for bathing if coliform bacteria levels remain within 2,500 per 100 milliliters. However, CPCB warned that exceeding this limit could lead to skin infections and other health issues.




The NGT bench, after reviewing the report submitted on February 3, criticized the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board for failing to regulate pollution effectively. The tribunal has scheduled the next hearing on the matter for February 19.

https://vygrnews.com/events/the-ecological-impact-of-the-2025-maha-kumbh-mela-on-the-ganga-river,The Ecological Impact of the 2025 Maha Kumbh Mela on the Ganga River,"As the 2025 Maha Kumbh Mela unfolds in Prayagraj, the confluence of the Ganga and Yamuna rivers is once again at the center of a significant cultural and religious event. However, this gathering of millions raises pressing concerns about the ecological health of these sacred waters.




Environmental Challenges




The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has mandated that the Uttar Pradesh government and the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) ensure that no untreated sewage is discharged into the Ganga and Yamuna during the event. This directive comes in response to projections that sewage generation could increase by 10% during the festival, potentially leading to a discharge of approximately 519 million liters per day (MLD) into these rivers.




With only about 450 MLD expected to be treated at existing sewage treatment plants (STPs), concerns about water quality remain paramount.




Historically, mass bathing during Kumbh Mela has been linked to a spike in pollution levels. For instance, during previous events, studies indicated alarming increases in biological oxygen demand (BOD) levels in the Ganga, with some measurements reaching as high as 250 mg per liter.




The sheer volume of pilgrims—estimated to reach 100 million over the course of the festival—exacerbates these issues, as each individual contributes to waste generation that overwhelms local waste management systems




The Other Side: Efforts for Cleanliness




In light of these challenges, authorities are implementing measures aimed at mitigating environmental impacts. The NGT's recent orders include increasing monitoring points along the rivers and ensuring regular water quality testing.




Additionally, there are efforts to manage solid waste generated during the event, which includes food packaging and other non-biodegradable materials that can further pollute the rivers




While temporary solutions have been put in place—such as enhanced sewage treatment capabilities during the Kumbh—the long-term effectiveness of these measures remains questionable. Critics argue that despite these efforts, the Ganga continues to suffer from chronic pollution issues exacerbated by large gatherings like the Kumbh Mela.




Cultural Significance vs. Ecological Integrity




The Kumbh Mela is not just a religious event; it represents a deep-rooted cultural tradition for millions of Hindus who believe that bathing in these sacred waters can cleanse sins and provide spiritual salvation. However, this ritualistic cleansing paradoxically contributes to ecological degradation. The influx of pilgrims leads to increased fecal contamination and various pollutants entering the river ecosystem, which can harm aquatic life and disrupt local biodiversity.




Moreover, infrastructure development associated with such large events often leads to habitat disruption. Increased noise pollution and construction activities can damage riverbanks and spawning grounds for fish, further threatening aquatic biodiversity.




Conclusion




As Prayagraj prepares for the Maha Kumbh Mela, it faces a critical juncture between honoring a cherished spiritual tradition and safeguarding the ecological health of its revered rivers. While authorities are striving to implement measures to protect water quality, the ongoing challenges posed by untreated sewage and waste management highlight a need for sustainable practices that respect both cultural heritage and environmental integrity. The success of these efforts will not only determine the immediate health of the Ganga but also set a precedent for future gatherings that celebrate faith amidst ecological responsibility.




How do sewage treatment plants handle the increased waste during the festival?




Sewage treatment plants (STPs) are crucial in managing the increased waste generated during large events like the Maha Kumbh Mela. As millions of pilgrims gather, the volume of sewage produced can significantly exceed normal levels, necessitating efficient and effective treatment processes.




Handling Increased Waste During the Festival




Preliminary Treatment: STPs begin by screening incoming sewage to remove large debris such as rags and sticks. This step is essential to prevent damage to equipment and ensure smooth operation during peak loads.




. Primary Treatment: After screening, sewage flows into sedimentation tanks where solids settle at the bottom. This process can remove up to 60% of solids from the wastewater, allowing clearer water to move on to the next stages.




. Secondary Treatment: This stage employs biological processes where microorganisms break down organic matter. Aeration tanks introduce air to support aerobic bacteria, which consume pollutants, converting them into carbon dioxide and water




. The treated water is then clarified to separate remaining biomass from the liquid. Tertiary Treatment: In many cases, especially during festivals, a tertiary treatment stage is implemented to further purify the water before discharge. This may involve advanced filtration or chemical treatments to ensure that the water meets environmental standards for safe release back into the Ganga or Yamuna rivers.




Enhanced Capacity and Infrastructure




To accommodate the surge in waste during the Kumbh Mela, STPs often increase their operational capacity temporarily. This could involve:




Deploying Mobile Treatment Units : These units can be set up quickly to handle additional sewage loads without overburdening existing facilities.




Collaboration with Local Authorities: STPs work closely with event organizers and local governments to anticipate waste generation patterns and adjust their operations accordingly.




Challenges and Solutions




Despite these measures, challenges remain:




Infrastructure Limitations : Many STPs may not be equipped to handle sudden spikes in wastewater volume effectively.




Public Awareness: Ensuring that festival-goers are aware of proper waste disposal practices is vital in reducing the overall load on sewage systems.




In summary, STPs play a critical role in managing increased waste during large events like the Maha Kumbh Mela through a series of structured treatment processes. By enhancing capacity and infrastructure while promoting public awareness, these plants aim to mitigate the environmental impact on sacred rivers like the Ganga and Yamuna.

The Ardh Kumbh festival, where millions of people bathe in the Ganga, took place from January to March this year.




The National Green Tribunal has recommended slapping a fine on the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board for the sorry state of rivers in U.P.




Experts say the gap between sewage generation and the capacity to treat it is widening fast in Prayagraj.




Tomorrow, March 14, is the International Day of Action for Rivers where globally, people celebrate life-giving waters and honor all those who have worked hard to ensure that rivers continue flowing. See All Key Ideas




On February 24, the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was on the banks of River Ganga in Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh. He was among the millions of people from India and abroad who bathed in the river during the Ardh Kumbh Mela, which took place from January 15 to March 4 in Prayagraj (formerly known as Allahabad). The Kumbh Mela is a mass Hindu pilgrimage held on the banks of the Ganga in Prayagraj and three other cities, Haridwar, Nashik and Ujjain, at different time intervals. Bathing in the river is believed to wash away one’s sins.




However, a report released by the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) for January has revealed that the Ganga at Prayagraj, both upstream and downstream, is unsafe for bathing and could expose people to extremely high levels of coliform bacteria, mostly the faecal coliform, Escherichia coli.




Holding it responsible for the sorry state of rivers in Uttar Pradesh, the National Green Tribunal last month recommended slapping a fine of Rs. 40 million (Rs. 4 crores) on the UPPCB. The tribunal accused the board of “culpable negligence” and of a “collusive act between industries and the board”.




Although the central and state governments had taken several measures to improve the water quality of the Ganga ahead of the 49-day long, Rs. 42 billion affair (Rs. 4,200 crores), the latest survey of the water by the pollution watchdog paints quite a dirty picture. The pilgrimage had an estimated footfall of 150 million this year.




Faecal coliform bacteria enter rivers through untreated sewerage. The maximum permissible limit for total coliforms (TC), a scientific parameter to measure water quality, stipulated by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) for organised outdoor bathing is 500 MPN/100 ml (MPN = most probable number). In January, the TC count in the Ganga at Prayagraj was 17,000 MPN/100 ml and 20,000 MPN/100 ml upstream and downstream respectively — 35 to 40 times higher than the maximum permissible limit.




“Faecal coliforms (9,300 MPN upstream and 11,000 MPN downstream in Prayagraj Ganga) contribute to almost half the TC in the samples,” said Dr. Ashok Verma, a senior UPPCB scientist.




“The presence of faecal coliform in high numbers indicate the presence of pathogens in the water that usually comes from human and animal excreta. These might lead to water-borne diseases such as diarrhoea,” said Dr. S. Mani, a Lucknow-based medical practitioner.




Meanwhile, according to a UPPCB official, the yet-to-be-released report for February is expected to be worse as the river at Prayagraj turned black on March 2 due to the filth generated from heavy human activity.




The only consolation, if it at all, is the fact that water quality was better in January compared to December 2018 (22,000 MPN upstream, 21,000 MPN downstream), when the government initiated efforts to improve water quality before the Ardh Kumbh mela started. Additionally, the Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), another crucial quality parameter, at the incoming and outgoing stretches of the river was within permissible levels (3 mg per litre or less) in January 2019, whereas in December it was 3.2 and 3.4 mg per litre in the incoming and outgoing stretches respectively. The BOD level indicates the amount of oxygen needed by microbes to decompose the organic matter in the water. “If the BOD level exceeds beyond 3 mg/l, it indicates the presence of high industrial toxins that are not degraded by water organisms and means that the water is not suitable for even domestic purposes like washing, let alone consumption,” a pollution board official said.




Lack of political will and planning loopholes mar Clean Ganga efforts




In the run-up to the Ardh Kumbh Mela, the state had ordered the closure of all 402 tanneries in Kanpur and Unnao districts between December 15 and March 15 to ensure that industrial toxins don’t make their way into the Ganga at Prayagraj. Engineers were deployed to monitor water treatment on 227 drains across the state that fall into the Ganga.




In addition to this, the sewage treatment capacity at existing plants was strengthened under the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG). Projects worth Rs. 9 billion (Rs. 900 crores) were completed before the Ardh Kumbh which included laying of sewage network in uncovered areas, building seven sewage pumping stations and three treatment plants of total capacity of 72 million litres per day. This raised the city’s capacity to treat sewage up to 330 million litres per day of sewage, which is nearly the amount it generates, up from about 260 MLD.




The state irrigation and water resources department had also been releasing an extra 3,000 cusec of water daily into the river from various barrages in order to maintain an adequate amount of water necessary to keep pollution in check. On the days of ‘shahi snan’ (royal or holy bath), 8,000 cusecs were released.




However, none of these precautionary steps seemed to serve the purpose.




The amicus curiae of Allahabad High Court in the Ganga pollution case and member of the draft committee of the National River Ganga (Rejuvenation, Protection and Management) Bill 2017, Arun Kumar Gupta, said, “The scientific indicators are alarming and exposes the corruption and lack of political will at every level. It is only because of the courts’ directions that the centre or state authorities took any step at all to clean the Ganga.”




The National Mission for Clean Ganga or Namami Gange, the flagship project of the Modi government, was allocated Rs. 263 billion (Rs. 26,300 crores) since 2015 for abatement of pollution, setting up sewage treatment plants (STPs) and development of riverfronts and crematoria on the Ganga across the country.




Only Rs. 61 billion (Rs. 6,100 crores), or 25 percent, of the allocated, had been utilised till January 2019. “This proves the half-hearted approach towards the mission,” said a Kanpur leather exporter, on the condition of anonymity, whose business has come to a standstill since the past two-and-half months after the government’s orders to close of tanneries.




According to Gupta, the gap between sewage generated and the capacity to treat it is widening fast in Prayagraj. The generation of sewage is calculated on the basis of civic water supply. The government doesn’t take into account the household water pumps that extract groundwater illegally due to inadequate civic supply. Explaining the possible reasons for faecal contamination in the river water, Gupta said, “At Kumbh, only chemical treatment of sewage was being done – this doesn’t necessarily remove micro-organisms. The fact is that due to diversion of drains (where some drains not connected to STPs before, were diverted towards these drains) some sewage treatment plants (STPs) were loaded beyond their capacity, leading to a large amount of untreated sewage making its way into the river. The STP modules are also not the most effective as they pass quickly through a short tract of sand-bed, a natural purifier, before meeting the river.”




To make matter worse, half of the treated sewage gets contaminated again due to open defecation and mixing of faecal sludge at few places, suggests by a 2018 report published by the Centre for Science and Environment.




Said Gupta, “Flood-planes of the river have been encroached upon by property developers over the years, which has led to a drastic decrease in sand bed, a natural water purifier. Five small streams of Ganga enter in Prayagraj. Four of them were filled with sand for the Ardh Kumbh so that more land is available for use. In the process, aquatic biodiversity, including nesting areas of fish and turtles, is destroyed.”




The Yamuna, Assi and Varuna rivers, which merge in the Ganga, also add to the pollution load as do open defecation and over-exploitation of river water for irrigation purposes, say locals.




Different places, same story




The plight of the Ganga is no different in the 30 other cities in Uttar Pradesh that the river flows through. Of the 31 monitoring stations in the state, for which the latest faecal coliform contamination data is available in 2019, 25 were found to be way below desired standards set by the UPPCB. Some of the most polluted stretches were at Varanasi, Prayagraj and Kanpur.




While the TC count was 4,600 MPN/100 ml upstream and 34,000 MPN/100 ml downstream of Kanpur in January 2019, in Varansi, Modi’s own constituency, recorded a TC count of 1,300 upstream and 43,000 downstream.




Gupta said, “Presently 2,000 million litres per day of sewage is generated in the 30 cities through which the Ganga flows. Three-fourths of this amount goes straight into the Ganga because sewage is being treated only in Prayagraj, Kanpur and Varanasi, and that too partially.”




The narrative is the same across the country. Reports documented by the Central Pollution Control Board, which examine the 2,525-km long Ganga at 80 sites starting from Gangotri, where the river originates, to the Bay of Bengal where it ends, say that the Ganga is unfit along its entire course, barring one spot at the border of UP and Bihar. Biological species are also at high risk due to the rising pollution. A 2018 CPCB report gives Varanasi and Prayagraj ‘severe’ and ‘moderate’ pollution status respectively.

While the TC count was 4,600 MPN/100 ml upstream and 34,000 MPN/100 ml downstream of Kanpur in January 2019, in Varansi, Modi’s own constituency, recorded a TC count of 1,300 upstream and 43,000 downstream. Gupta said, “Presently 2,000 million litres per day of sewage is generated in the 30 cities through which the Ganga flows. Three-fourths of this amount goes straight into the Ganga because sewage is being treated only in Prayagraj, Kanpur and Varanasi, and that too partially.” The narrative is the same across the country. Reports documented by the Central Pollution Control Board, which examine the 2,525-km long Ganga at 80 sites starting from Gangotri, where the river originates, to the Bay of Bengal where it ends, say that the Ganga is unfit along its entire course, barring one spot at the border of UP and Bihar. Biological species are also at high risk due to the rising pollution. A 2018 CPCB report gives Varanasi and Prayagraj ‘severe’ and ‘moderate’ pollution status respectively.

https://theunn.com/millions-participate-in-kumbh-mela-despite-concerns-over-overcrowding-and-pollution/,Millions Participate in Kumbh Mela Despite Concerns Over Overcrowding and Pollution,"Hundreds of millions of Hindu devotees have gathered to bathe in sacred waters, undeterred by concerns regarding overcrowding and pollution, as the world’s largest religious gathering concluded on Wednesday in India’s northern state of Uttar Pradesh.




Over a span of 45 days, the Maha Kumbh Mela, also known as the festival of the Sacred Pitcher, drew more than 620 million attendees—accounting for nearly one-third of India’s estimated 1.4 billion population. The event, held along the riverbanks in Prayagraj, was a grand display of color and devotion.




Pilgrims participated in a holy dip at the Triveni Sangam, the confluence of three sacred rivers—the Ganges, Yamuna, and the mythical Saraswati—believing that this act would purify their sins and bring them closer to “spiritual liberation.”




This festival, which occurs every 12 years with the prefix “Maha,” meaning great, is the largest form of the Kumbh Mela, which is otherwise held every three years in one of four designated cities.




“It is a unique, once-in-a-lifetime experience,” remarked Sushovan Sircar, a 36-year-old independent consultant from Delhi. “People from all over India are here, as I saw number plates of cars from almost every state.”




Despite concerns about overcrowding and reports of high contamination levels in key bathing sites, millions participated in the event. However, the celebrations were overshadowed by two separate tragic crowd crush incidents.




A report from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), part of India’s Environment Ministry, highlighted alarming levels of coliform bacteria in the Ganges and Yamuna rivers. This finding raised concerns despite the government’s emphasis on sustainability initiatives and sanitation measures.




Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath dismissed the government report’s accuracy, asserting that the water was not only safe for bathing but also suitable for the Hindu ritual of drinking a handful after immersion.




Pilgrims often fully submerge themselves in the water, with some drinking or collecting the sacred water in containers.




‘My Sins Are Cleansed, But Not My Body’




Sircar recounted his experience of bathing at Sangam point—the most revered spot where the three rivers meet—twice last week.




“There is a concern because there is nothing I can do about the contamination in the water. In your mind, you tell yourself, this part looks clean, spend a few minutes in, recite prayers and come out,” he said.




He added humorously, “I took a shower for sins and then another shower for the contamination. So you need a bath after the bath… My sins are cleansed, but not (my) body.”




Ahead of the festival, India’s top environmental court had instructed state and federal pollution boards to ensure that the river water was clean enough for both drinking and bathing. The court mandated increased monitoring and sample collection of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers, prohibiting any discharge of untreated sewage or solid waste.




However, a report submitted by the federal pollution board on February 3 revealed that faecal coliform levels, a key indicator of untreated sewage, were significantly above the safe limit of 2,500 units per 100 milliliters.




At multiple locations along the Ganges and Yamuna rivers near Prayagraj, the contamination levels exceeded the safe threshold by more than 1,000 times, according to the report.




Adityanath assured that his administration was continuously monitoring water levels to maintain quality standards.




Kumbh Mela organizers also defended their efforts, stating that an “exhaustive survey” was conducted on all 81 drains that release water into the rivers before the festival began.




“We have ensured that the water quality has been maintained,” said Vivek Chaturvedi, an official overseeing the Kumbh Mela.




Aishwary Sharma, a 31-year-old finance professional from Delhi, admitted he was aware of the potential pollution but still took part in the ritual.




“I think it is quite evident that the Ganga and Yamuna are not clean rivers,” he stated. “(But) there are many things that are bad for you… The air we breathe is so toxic for our health… It is just another thing that is polluted that could have a harmful impact on my health.”




For many, faith and devotion took precedence over health concerns.




“What (most people) are interested in is their devotion and religion and that they want to take that holy dip,” said Sunny Parasher, a 34-year-old from Panchkula in Haryana.




“Where there is devotion, where there is religion, there is no question,” he emphasized.




However, Kalpana Mishra, a 55-year-old housewife from Prayagraj, decided against taking another holy dip after reading the pollution board’s report.




“What does being a literate person mean if you hear all this and still decide to go?” she questioned.




Health experts warn that exposure to faecal contamination can cause waterborne diseases such as typhoid, diarrhea, cholera, gastroenteritis, E. coli infections, skin ailments, and vomiting.




Push to Clean the Rivers




Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has prioritized cleaning the Ganges since assuming office in 2014, dedicating billions of dollars to sewage treatment, surface waste cleanup, and afforestation efforts.




The Ganges supports 400 million people who rely on it for their livelihood, but 50 cities along its course discharge nearly 3 billion liters of sewage daily. According to the World Bank, only a fraction of this waste undergoes treatment before entering the river.




The Yamuna, a major tributary of the Ganges, has also been severely impacted by untreated sewage and industrial chemicals for decades.




Ahead of the festival, authorities promoted the event as a “Green Kumbh,” emphasizing sustainability initiatives such as banning single-use plastics, introducing eco-friendly toilets, deploying electric rickshaws, and hiring 15,000 sanitation workers to manage waste during major bathing days.




In January, the Ministry of Culture stated that the festival had been “meticulously planned to uphold hygiene and ecological balance,” describing it as a model for future large-scale events worldwide.




Environmental responsibility was a major topic at a conference held during the festival, where religious and environmental leaders discussed ways in which religious institutions could contribute to addressing the climate crisis.




“If there is no water in the rivers, there is no Kumbh. We don’t consider it water, we consider it nectar,” said Swami Chidanand Saraswati, an Indian spiritual leader. “If we all do not make efforts to protect it, then the next (Kumbh Mela) will be on mere sand.”




Despite these efforts, the overwhelming turnout posed a significant challenge. The festival saw 250 million more attendees than initially anticipated. Authorities had planned for approximately 400 million people over six weeks—averaging about 9 million per day—but government estimates indicate that around 620 million participated.




“It is a mammoth task to take care of such a crowd,” stated Dr. Nupur Bahadur, associate director at The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), a research institute specializing in wastewater management.




To mitigate river contamination, Bahadur suggested implementing better on-site prevention and disinfection strategies.




“One of them could be halting the dip after every 12 hours for one hour” and allowing fresh water to flow through the bathing areas before “the dips can be restarted,” she proposed.




While the festival’s record-breaking turnout strained its infrastructure, Bahadur acknowledged that the management had achieved “the best human effort possible” under the circumstances.




For residents of Prayagraj, however, the return to normal life could not come soon enough.




“My eyes are constantly burning and there is so much dust,” said Mishra. “I want the festival to end so I can get back to my life.”",Indian,UNN News,"Hundreds of millions of Hindu devotees have gathered to bathe in sacred waters, undeterred by concerns regarding overcrowding and pollution, as the world’s largest religious gathering concluded on Wednesday in India’s northern state of Uttar Pradesh.

New Delhi: The sacred waters of the Ganga and Yamuna are under scrutiny as health officials raise alarms over significant contamination during the Maha Kumbh Mela 2025, held at Prayagraj. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has reported alarming levels of faecal coliform bacteria, which exceeds acceptable limits for bathing water, posing serious public health concerns for millions of participating devotees.




According to the CPCB's report submitted to the National Green Tribunal (NGT), the levels of faecal coliform—a key indicator of microbial contamination—were found to be staggeringly high. On January 13, 2025, faecal coliform concentrations reached around 23,000 MPN/100ml at Shringverpur Ghat and soared to 700,000 MPN/100ml at the sacred Sangam area just days later, on January 20. Notably, the permissible limit for this bacteria type for bathing water is 2,500 units per 100 ml.




This contamination problem is worsened by several factors, including untreated sewage discharge, open defecation, and the massive influx of pilgrims who come to perform ritualistic baths, especially on auspicious days. With millions expected to bathe during the festival, the danger of spreading waterborne diseases increases. ""The river water quality was not conforming with the primary water quality for bathing with reference to faecal coliform [FC] at all the monitored locations on various occasions,"" stated the NGT, reflecting the serious nature of the situation.




The Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) was criticized by the NGT for its inadequate reporting and lack of comprehensive plans to tackle the pollution issue. A hearing on February 19 highlights the urgency placed upon state authorities to address these health hazards effectively. ""Even upon reviewing the documents... high levels of faecal and total coliform have been found at various locations,"" noted the NGT order.




Environmental and public health experts are deeply concerned. They have pointed out the potential for severe health risks, including gastrointestinal infections, skin and eye disorders, typhoid, and hepatitis, especially among the vulnerable segments of the population, such as children and the elderly. The presence of faecal coliform indicates possible sewage contamination, which raises alarms over the risk of disease-causing pathogens.




Despite these grave concerns, Union Minister for Science and Technology Jitendra Singh claimed during his visit to Prayagraj on January 30, 2025, ""Not even a single case of skin disease or other illness has been reported from the Kumbh Mela."" He attributed the cleanliness of the river to technology contributed by India's nuclear research facilities, claiming it helps maintain hygiene standards at the event.




Nevertheless, experts are urging the government to take immediate steps to curb pollution. ""There are 10 sewage treatment plants (STPs) established around Prayagraj, but the Ponghat STP reportedly failed to meet environmental norms, leading to concerns about its effect on water quality,"" they pointed out. There is also considerable public pressure for increasing sewage treatment efficiency and preventing untreated waste from entering the river.




During the Kumbh Mela, authorities have urged the akharas (spiritual groups) to adhere to scheduled timings to allow for cleaning operations, and they have been distributing cloth bags and stainless steel utensils to minimize plastic waste disposal issues. This initiative, along with increased monitoring of water quality by the CPCB and UPPCB, is seen as necessary to protect the health of the millions who honor the Ganga's sacredness by bathing amid festivities.




The Maha Kumbh Mela, among the largest religious gatherings globally, not only has deep cultural and religious ties but also presents significant environmental and public health challenges. Observations call for immediate regulatory action from the NGT and continued efforts to restore and maintain the Ganga and Yamuna's water quality as the festival progresses.




While the NGT has called for accountability, the outcome of their directives to tackle the increasing pollution remains to be seen.

INTRODUCTION This Ghat is a series of steps that lead to water bodies, namely rivers and Lakes. These Ghats are usually used for religious, ceremonial purposes etc. According to the Hindu religion, some rivers are described as sacred rivers, and it is believed that performing various purposes, including Religious rituals, bathing, and cremation, can lead to God's place in heaven. This psychology of humans/pilgrims plays an important role in social and Cultural activity at the Ghats. The banks of river ganga, Yamuna, Godawari and shipra are the main Ghats for kumbh mela, millions of people visit these places, during this large gathering a celebtaions with faith which has great significance of bathing as the main ritual in the holy river, believed to free sins and bring positivity to life. The Kumbh Mela is a massive Hindu pilgrimage and festival, considered the world's largest peaceful gathering. It's a deeply religious event where devotees believe bathing in sacred rivers cleanses sins and aids in achieving liberation. Held every three years, the Mela rotates among four pilgrimage sites on four holy rivers, creating a cycle that spans twelve years. Each Mela lasts for several weeks and includes not only ritual bathing but also fairs, religious speeches, and gatherings of monks. The Kumbh Mela is a unique fusion of faith, community, and culture, making it a landmark event in Hinduism. These large gatherings bring along many environment challenges. The increase in waste generation because of large number of people, often Hampers the management. The type of waste and its quantity during the kumbh mela has negative impacts on the river water thus polluting the water, adding stress on the sewage system because of increased of number of people makes it even more dangerous. The potential health risk associated with the river during the kumbh mela. The spread of diseases caused by continamated water, impacts the pilgrims as well as the local. Potential solutions for the improvement of the environmental condition caused because of waste generation during kumbh mela and minimizing the environmental impacts.

Kumbh Mela: A spiritual Journey Mythological Significance: The Kumbh Mela endures because of humanity's unwavering quest for the divine, in spite of the reality around it that is always changing. This age-old celebration is timeless because it is weaved from myth and heavenly alignments. It serves as a bridge, bringing us into contact with the knowledge of our forefathers while brightly reflecting the present. This is a celebration of life itself, throbbing with faith and a strong sense of oneness, where religion takes a second seat to a broader gathering. The Kumbh Mela provides a pause in a world when speed is everything, reminding us of the timeless values of spirituality, traditions, and the deep bonds that unite us as a community. From the hallowed dips to the echoing chants and assemblies of holy men, the rituals themselves are symbols of profound spiritual importance that strengthen our faith in a power much bigger than ourselves.

Socio-cultural Impact: The Kumbh Mela's profound socio- cultural impact. They examine the event's role in strengthening social bonds by bringing together devotees from diverse backgrounds. The Mela fosters community spirit through shared rituals and cultural exchange, creating a temporary yet vibrant social space. Types of Kumbh Mela. Maha Kumbh Mela: For Hindus, the Maha Kumbh Mela is an event that comes just once in a lifetime. Every 144 years, or after 12 Purna Kumbh Melas, there is a Maha Kumbh Mela. It takes place just in Prayag. Millions of people bathe in the sacred water during the Maha Kumbh. According to a tradition, Lord Brahma reportedly said that bathing or dipping in the Ganges' sacred water would free people from their sins. Hindus also think that bathing in the Ganges may cleanse individuals and their ancestors going back eighty- eight generations of sins and evils, particularly during Maha Kumbh. The next Maha Kumbh will take place 144 years after the previous one ended in 2013.




Purna Kumbh Mela: In Allahabad, this Kumbh Mela takes place every twelve years. Thousands of pilgrims bathe in the sacred Sangam. Millions of pilgrims attend ths well structured and auspicious bazaar. 2013 was the final Purna Kumbh Mela.




Ardh Kumbh Mela: ""Ardh"" means ""half"" and ""Mela"" means ""fair"" in Hindi. Since the fair is held every six years, it is also known as Ardh Kumbh. It denotes the midpoint between the Purna Kumbh Melas, which are held every twelve years. There are just two locations for the Ardh Kumbh: Allahabad and Haridwar. In Haridwar, the next Ardh Kumbh Mela is scheduled for 2016.




Kumbh Mela: The four locations of the Kumbh Mela are Ujjain, Allahabad, Nashik, and Haridwar. Millions of devotees visit the massively organised Kumbh Mela and IJERTV13IS080033 partake in the sacred bath. The timing and location of the Kumbh Mela are determined by the sun's and Jupiter's planetary positions. Environmental concerns and religous faith in Kumbh Mela Water Quality: A paradox of Purification Millions descend upon the ghats during the Kumbh Mela, seeking spiritual cleansing through ritual bathing (snan) in the sacred rivers. While this act holds immense significance, it creates a paradoxical situation for the very waters they revere. The sheer volume of people releases a significant amount of fecal coli form bacteria and other pollutants. Offerings like flowers, puja materials, and even soap meant to be acts of devotion contribute to organic and inorganic pollution. This can lead to a decline in dissolved oxygen levels, harming the aquatic life that thrives within these rivers, considered sacred forms of life themselves. Essentially, the very act of seeking purification in the river can unintentionally diminish its ability to purify. Waste Management: A Challenge to Scared Spaces.




The Kumbh Mela generates a staggering amount of solid waste. Food packaging, plastic bottles, disposable utensils, and floral offerings accumulate rapidly, overwhelming existing waste management systems. Inefficient collection and improper disposal can lead to overflowing landfills, littering the ghats and surrounding areas. This not only creates an unsightly environment but also pollutes the rivers themselves. The plastic and other non-biodegradable waste can travel long distances, eventually reaching the oceans, further threatening the delicate balance of the ecosystem. The very act of celebrating on the sacred ghats can unintentionally defile the sanctity of the space. Location River Potential Scale Waste Generation Concerns Water quality Concerns. Prayagraj (Allahabad ) Ganga and Yamuna Sangam Largest gathering. Higest potential waste generation due to massive crowds Higest potential for pollution due to confluence of rivers and sheer volume of pilgrims. Haridwar Ganga Large Gathering. Significant waste generation, Straining sanitation infrastructure Increased feceal coliform bacteria and potential microplastic pollution. Nashik Godavari Medium sized Gathering. Lower waste generation compared to prayagraj and haridwar, but still requires proper management. Potential for pollution in the Godawari river, especially if waste managemen t is inadequate. ujjain Shipra Smaller gathering. Relatively lower waste generation, but crucial to Shipra River is already considered a polluted manage effectively to protect the smaller river. river. Kumbh mela can Exacerbate the issue. Tab. Comparison of waste and water Quality Concern at All 4 locations (This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.) Biodiversity loss: Disrupting the harmony of nature- The influx of millions of pilgrims and the associated infrastructure development for the Kumbh Mela can disrupt the delicate ecological balance of the reverie ecosystems. Increased noise pollution can disturb aquatic life, while construction activities can damage riverbanks and affect spawning grounds for fish. Additionally, the use of chemical pesticides to control insects during the Mela can further harm aquatic biodiversity. These actions disrupt the harmonious relationship between humanity and nature that the Kumbh Mela itself strives to celebrate. The very act of seeking spiritual connection in nature can inadvertently harm the natural world that is a source of spiritual sustenance.




Public Health Concerns: A shadow cast on the Festivities- Poor sanitation facilities and inadequate waste management during the Kumbh Mela create breeding grounds for mosquitoes and other disease-carrying insects. This can lead to outbreaks of waterborne diseases like cholera, typhoid, and diarrhea, posing a significant health risk to pilgrims and local residents alike. The very gathering that celebrates life and spiritual well-being can unintentionally endanger the health of those who participate.




Health Risk Diseases: The Major health concerns during Kumbh Mela are Because of waterborne diseases. As studied and documented there is a rise in case of cholera, gastrointestinal illness and thyroid fever. Which impacts the health of local residents and pilgrims during the kumbh mela.These diseases are caused because of continamanted water which contains harmful bacteria, parasites and viruses. Along with these waterborne diseases, there are many other health risks which are associated with exposure to micro plastic, meaning the tiny plastic particles are found in aquatic environment.

UPSC Syllabus Topic: GS Paper3- Environment




Context: The article discusses water pollution in the Ganga during the Maha Kumbh Mela at Prayagraj. It highlights fluctuating contamination levels, with faecal coliform exceeding safe limits. Despite this, Uttar Pradesh’s Chief Minister dismissed concerns. The article stresses the need for sustained cleanup efforts.




How does the Maha Kumbh Mela affect water quality in the Ganga?




Around 45 crore visitors have attended the Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj since mid-January. Many people take ritual baths and drink the river water. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) monitors water quality during the festival. On Makar Sankranti (January 14), faecal coliform levels were 11,000 units at Sangam Ghat (4 times the safe limit of 2,500 units). At Old Naini Bridge Ghat, faecal coliform levels were 33,000 units. On other days, levels dropped to 200 and 780 units, showing fluctuations. CPCB also recorded changes in biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and dissolved oxygen (DO) levels.




Is the Ganga water safe for bathing and drinking?




A CPCB report (February 3, 2025) stated that on January 12-13, water was not fit for bathing or drinking. The Ganga’s pollution worsens during large gatherings, as seen in the Maha Kumbh Mela. Routine CPCB monitoring shows that the Ganga at Prayagraj is not safe for consumption year-round. Water quality depends on flow and dilution, which varies throughout the year.




How has the government responded to pollution concerns?




Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath dismissed the CPCB data as “baseless.” The National Mission for Clean Ganga aims to restore the river’s health. Uttar Pradesh, being the largest beneficiary, should focus on continuous cleanup efforts.




Conclusion




The Maha Kumbh Mela highlights the urgent need for long-term solutions to Ganga pollution. Authorities should acknowledge scientific findings rather than dismiss them. Science and faith can coexist—ensuring both religious traditions and environmental protection. Denying pollution issues does not help devotees; instead, sustained cleanup efforts are needed.

The Kumbh Mela (also known as Mahakumbh) - is held once every 12 years.




Hindus believe that taking a dip at Sangam - the confluence of India's most sacred Ganges river with the Yamuna river and the mythical Saraswati - will cleanse them of sins, purify their soul and help them attain salvation.




The Mela, which stretches over six weeks, draws devotees from all walks of life and from all around the world. Tens of millions have been bathing in the rivers daily during the festival, which will end on 26 February.




However, health activists and environmentalists have expressed concern over the water quality of the rivers during the festival.

Before the Mela began, India's top environment court had directed the pollution control boards of the federal and state governments to monitor the water in the rivers regularly and to take adequate steps to maintain its quality.




But a report submitted by the federal government's Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) earlier this month stated that the waters of the Ganges and Yamuna had high coliform levels.




Coliform level is a key indicator of the presence of untreated sewage and faecal bacteria in water.

The report said that the coliform levels in the Ganges were 1,400 times more than the acceptable limit, and in the Yamuna river, they were 660 times more.




The CPCB analysed water samples from both the rivers on five separate days in January, but the coliform levels never met standards, the report added.

Tens of millions of people participate in the Kumbh Mela [Getty Images] The Kumbh Mela (also known as Mahakumbh) - is held once every 12 years. Hindus believe that taking a dip at Sangam - the confluence of India's most sacred Ganges river with the Yamuna river and the mythical Saraswati - will cleanse them of sins, purify their soul and help them attain salvation. The Mela, which stretches over six weeks, draws devotees from all walks of life and from all around the world. Tens of millions have been bathing in the rivers daily during the festival, which will end on 26 February. However, health activists and environmentalists have expressed concern over the water quality of the rivers during the festival.

In a recent report, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) informed the National Green Tribunal (NGT) about the water quality of rivers with respect to Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD). The report stated that during monitoring conducted on January 12-13 in 2025, the river water quality did not meet the bathing criteria at most locations.












However, after this period, organic pollution (in terms of BOD) began to decrease due to the intrusion of freshwater at upstream locations. By January 13, 2025, the river water quality met the bathing criteria concerning BOD, except for the area around the Lord Curzon Bridge on the Ganga River on January 19, 2025.












The report also highlighted that the river water quality failed to meet the primary water quality standards for bathing concerning Fecal Coliform (FC) at all monitored locations on various occasions. The significant number of people bathing in the river at Prayagraj during the Maha Kumbh Mela, especially on auspicious bathing days, led to an increase in faecal concentration.












The report further stated that seven Geosynthetic Dewatering Tubes (geo-tube) filtration sites were operational at Prayagraj. A team from the CPCB visited all seven sites from January 6-8, 2025, to verify the installation status and again on January 18-19, 2025, for treatment verification.












Twenty-one drains were tapped and treated under the geo-tube system.












All seven geo-tubes were monitored, and samples were collected and analysed at the CPCB Regional Directorate (RD) Laboratory in Lucknow. According to the sample analysis results, all were found to be non-compliant with the prescribed norms as prescribed in the 55th Executive Committee meeting of the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) under the agenda.












On Monday, the Tribunal bench led by Justice Prakash Shrivastava noted that upon reviewing the documents enclosed with the covering letter dated January 28, 2025, from the in-charge of the Central Laboratory, UP PCB, high levels of faecal and total coliform were found at various locations.












The counsel for the State of UP requested one day to examine the reports and file a response. The tribunal directed the Member Secretary of UP PCB and the concerned State Authority responsible for maintaining the water quality in the Ganga River at Prayagraj to appear virtually on the next hearing date. The case has been listed for February 19, 2025, said the bench.












The Tribunal was considering grievances about the quality of water in the Ganga and Yamuna rivers in Prayagraj and examining allegations of untreated sewage discharge into these rivers, particularly concerning the Magh Mela and Kumbh Mela.












To ensure better monitoring and prevent the unwanted flow of untreated sewage into the Ganga and Yamuna rivers during the Maha Kumbh, the Tribunal directed the CPCB and Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) to increase their monitoring points and the frequency of monitoring. This measure aims to protect pilgrims who come for holy baths from suffering due to water contamination.












The CPCB and UPPCB were instructed to take water samples from the Ganga and Yamuna rivers at least twice a week at regular intervals while avoiding duplicating samples on the same day. The sample analysis reports are to be displayed on the UPPCB and CPCB websites. Additionally, the report will include the performance of Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) and geo-tubes.

However, a report by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has revealed that water quality in multiple locations does not meet primary bathing standards, raising significant public health concerns.




CPCB Report Reveals Severe Contamination According to the CPCB’s findings, faecal coliform—a key indicator of sewage pollution—has surpassed permissible limits at various monitoring sites in Prayagraj. As per CPCB guidelines, the acceptable level of faecal coliform for bathing water is 2,500 units per 100 ml. However, the CPCB reported that concentrations exceeded these limits, particularly during auspicious bathing days when the influx of pilgrims reaches its peak. The CPCB's report states, ""The river water quality was not conforming to the primary water quality for bathing with respect to faecal coliform (FC) at all the monitored locations on various occasions.""

""There is a significant variability in the values on various parameters, viz pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and fecal coliform count (FC) for the samples taken from the same location on different dates. The values of the afore-mentioned parameters also vary at different locations for the samples collected on the same day,"" the report said.




The DO or the amount of oxygen in water, BOD, which measures the amount of oxygen needed to break down organic matter in water, and FC, a marker of sewage contamination, are key indicators of water quality.




The report said that an expert committee examined the issue of ""variability in data"" and said that ""the data represents a snapshot of water quality at a specific location and time and may vary significantly depending upon factors such as upstream anthropogenic activities (human actions), rate of flow, depth of sampling, time of sampling, river current and mixing of currents, sampling location and such other multiple factors"".




""As a result, these values reflect water quality parameters at the exact time and place from where these water samples were collected, and may not fully represent the overall characteristics of the river, therefore, not necessarily reflecting the overall river water quality throughout the river stretch,"" it said.




The report also said that because of the variability, a statistical analysis of water quality data of various monitoring locations for the key parameters was undertaken from January 12 to February 22 at 10 locations of ""mass bathing"" and that 20 rounds of monitoring were done.




""It is submitted that as per the above-mentioned statistical analysis, the median value (central tendency of the data) of pH, DO, BOD and FC for the monitored stretches is within the respective criteria/permissible limits,"" the report noted.




According to the report, the median value for FC was 1,400 as compared to the permissible limit of 2,500 units per 100 ml, while the DO was 8.7 vis-a-vis the stipulated norm of being greater than 5 milligram per litre, and the BOD was 2.56 against the stipulated limit of less than or equal to 3 mg per litre.




On February 17, the CPCB had informed the tribunal through a report that various locations in Prayagraj during the Maha Kumbh were not conforming to the primary water quality for bathing with respect to the level of faecal coliform.




""The river water quality was not conforming to the primary water quality for bathing with respect to faecal coliform at all the monitored locations on various occasions.

Preparing for Maha Kumbh Mela 2025!,"Water Quality of the Ganga River: Current Status and Future Concerns




The Ganga River, revered as a holy water source in India, has long been plagued by severe pollution issues. As the Maha Kumbh Mela approaches in 2025, concerns regarding the river's water quality are paramount, especially given the expected influx of millions of pilgrims seeking to bathe in its waters.




Current Water Quality Status




Recent assessments indicate a notable improvement in the water quality of the Ganga, particularly at the Sangam point in Prayagraj, where the first Shahi Snan (royal bath) of the Maha Kumbh is set to occur. The Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) reported that as of January 2025, the Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) level was recorded at 3.0 mg/l and the Dissolved Oxygen (DO) level at 8.3 mg/l, making the water suitable for bathing. This improvement follows significant state interventions, including the temporary closure of industries discharging effluents into the river and the establishment of temporary sewage treatment plants (STPs).




However, challenges remain. On January 14, 2025, BOD levels were noted to exceed acceptable limits at 4 mg/l, indicating ongoing concerns about organic matter concentration in the water. Additionally, fecal coliform counts were measured at 3300 MPN/100 mL, surpassing the permissible limit of 2500 MPN/100 mL5. Such levels raise serious health concerns for pilgrims during the Kumbh Mela.




Historical Context and Ongoing Pollution Issues




Historically, the Ganga has been classified among the most polluted rivers globally, with studies revealing alarming levels of fecal coliform bacteria and heavy metals due to industrial runoff and untreated sewage discharge. For instance, a study indicated that fecal coliform counts could reach up to 100 million MPN per 100 mL in some areas. The leather industry in Kanpur has been a significant contributor to this pollution, using toxic chemicals that have led to chromium levels exceeding safe limits by over 70 times.




Despite past efforts and government initiatives aimed at cleaning the river, such as during the COVID-19 lockdown when temporary improvements were noted due to reduced industrial activity, long-term solutions remain elusive. Continuous monitoring and enforcement are crucial to maintain water quality standards.




Upcoming Concerns: Maha Kumbh Mela 2025




With millions expected to participate in rituals during the Maha Kumbh Mela from January 13 to February 26, 2025, authorities are under pressure to ensure that Ganga water meets safety standards for bathing and drinking. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has mandated that no untreated sewage be discharged into the river during this period and has called for enhanced monitoring by both state and central pollution control boards.




The projected increase in sewage generation during this event—estimated to rise by 10%—adds urgency to these measures. The NGT's directives emphasize maintaining BOD levels below 10 mg/l and ensuring fecal coliform counts remain within safe limits.




Conclusion




The Ganga River's water quality remains a pressing issue as it balances its sacred status with environmental realities. While recent improvements offer hope, ongoing monitoring and stringent regulatory measures are essential as millions prepare for their spiritual journeys in early 2025. The intersection of religious devotion and environmental stewardship will be critical in determining whether this holy river can sustain its revered status amidst modern challenges.

Senthil Vel, Expert Member gave a slew of directioms to the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) and Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), while directing them to ensure that the pilgrims visiting the Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 should not suffer and that no untreated sewage and solid waste is discharged in rivers Ganga and Yamuna.




Pursuant to the Tribunal’s order dated 09-12-2024 granting time to the State of UP to place on record the comprehensive sewage management system/plan prepared by the authorities in Prayagraj keeping in view the existing load and expected increased load during the Maha Kumbh 2025, the Principal Secretary, Environment, Forest and Climate Change Department, State of UP submitted an affidavit disclosing the present status of the generation and treatment of sewage, the expected increase on account of influx during the Maha Kumbh Mela, the current status of flow in the drains and expected increase and the steps that were taken to ensure the prevention of discharge of untreated sewage in river Ganga and Yamuna in Prayagraj.




The Tribunal noted that at Daraganj, Prayagraj, and Mehdauri Colony, Rasulabad, the State has adopted geo-tube treatment to prevent the discharge of untreated sewage into the Ganga. The State also stated that during the Maha Kumbh 2025, no drain in Prayagraj will discharge untreated sewage in Ganga or Yamuna and that it would ensure that the water quality does not go above 30 mg/l of BOD though the attempt would be aimed at maintaining the standard of 10 mg/l of BOD and faecal coliform to be 100 MPN/100 ml.




The Tribunal gave the following directions:




1. During the Maha Kumbh Mela, in order to have a better monitoring mechanism and to ensure that on account of the unwanted flow of untreated sewage in river Ganga and Yamuna, the pilgrims who come for holy bath may not suffer, the CPCB and UPPCB will increase their monitoring points and frequency of monitoring on river Ganga and Yamuna.




2. The CPCB and UPPCB will take the water samples from river Ganga and Yamuna from the points at least twice a week at regular intervals by avoiding duplicity of sample on the same day and will display the sample analysis report on the website of UPPCB and CPCB. The report will also include the performance of STPs and geo-tubes.




3. Periodic samples will be collected by UPPCB and CPCB at the outlet of Sewage Treatment Plants and advanced oxidation ponds and the analytical reports be uploaded on the website of UPPCB and CPCB.




4. The sample analysis report will be sent by CPCB and UPPCB during the Mela fortnightly to the Registrar General of the Tribunal so that in case of need, the matter can be listed for consideration again.




5. The solid waste generated during the Mela will be managed as per the prescribed Rules relating to its management and disposal.




6. During the six important bathing days of Magh Mela, the regulatory agencies will strengthen the management system and be more prompt in ensuring the compliance, especially during the days of increase footfall. The authorities will ensure that no untreated sewage and solid waste from any of the drains in Prayagraj is discharged into rivers Ganga and Yamuna. The UPPCB and CPCB shall ensure that the river water quality at all times is drinking water/bathing water quality.




7. During the Maha Kumbh and after the Maha Kumbh is over, the authorities will take steps for effective disposal of the sludge generated in the STPs and deposited in geo-tubes by following the requisite environmental norms and for the same, performance report shall be filed.

The statement comes in complete contradiction with the previous report submitted in February.




The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) report said the statistical analysis was necessitated because of ""variability of data"" in the samples collected from the same locations across different dates and on different locations on the same day, because of which these did not reflect the ""overall river water quality throughout the river stretch"".

CPCB Data Taken U-Turn Within a month? On 17 February, in compliance with the December order, the CPCB submitted a report which showed that faecal coliform and biochemical oxygen demand levels did not meet the bathing criteria of Sangam water in Prayagraj, during monitoring carried out in the second week of January.




The quality of water at the confluence of river Ganga and Yamuna at Prayagraj, at the ongoing Maha Kumbh, is failing to meet the primary standards for bathing. The water has high levels of faecal coliform, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) informed the National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Monday (February 17).




A CPCB report dated February 3 mentioned that faecal coliform levels at all monitored locations were above the permissible limit of 2,500 units per 100 ml, indicating significant sewage contamination.




However, a report dated February 28 and uploaded on the NGT's website on March 7 said the CPCB had conducted water monitoring twice a week from January 12 onwards, including on auspicious bathing days during Maha Kumbh, at five locations on Ganga river and two locations on Yamuna river.




""There is a significant variability in the values on various parameters, viz pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and fecal coliform count (FC) for the samples taken from the same location on different dates. The values of the afore-mentioned parameters also vary at different locations for the samples collected on the same day,"" the report said.




The DO or the amount of oxygen in water, BOD, which measures the amount of oxygen needed to break down organic matter in water, and FC, a marker of sewage contamination, are key indicators of water quality.




What did Latest CPCB Report Say on Maha Kumbh Water? The report said that an expert committee examined the issue of ""variability in data"" and said that ""the data represents a snapshot of water quality at a specific location and time and may vary significantly depending upon factors such as upstream anthropogenic activities (human actions), rate of flow, depth of sampling, time of sampling, river current and mixing of currents, sampling location and such other multiple factors"".




""As a result, these values reflect water quality parameters at the exact time and place from where these water samples were collected, and may not fully represent the overall characteristics of the river, therefore, not necessarily reflecting the overall river water quality throughout the river stretch,"" it said.




The report also said that because of the variability, a statistical analysis of Ganga and Yamuna water quality data of various monitoring locations for the key parameters was undertaken from January 12 to February 22 at 10 locations of ""mass bathing"" and that 20 rounds of monitoring were done.

https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/mar/28/kumbh-mela-cleaning-up-after-the-worlds-largest-human-gathering,Kumbh Mela: cleaning up after the world’s largest human gathering,"As the sun sets over the Ganges, Vikas Kumar drives his garbage truck through the streets of Prayagraj, a historic Indian city of 1.1 million that was until last year known as Allahabad. “All this stuff people have been eating, drinking and throwing away,” he says, gesturing at piles of food waste, discarded water bottles and mud-spattered flowers. “It will take three or four months to clear.”




Over a 50-day period this normally sleepy city has been visited by around 220 million people for the Kumbh Mela – a Hindu pilgrimage dubbed the world’s largest human gathering.




As Kumar and his team collect garbage, scores of workers are dismantling the vast “pop-up city” they helped build – a temporary megalopolis two-thirds the size of Manhattan, containing more than 4,000 tents erected to house pilgrims, organisers, cultural programmes and shrines.




The temporary infrastructure organisers needed to lay down ahead of time was extensive: 185 miles of temporary metal roads, nearly two dozen pontoon bridges, 120,000 toilets and more than 100 police stations or posts.

Contracts were awarded to private companies to erect different sections of the pop-up tent city, and it was built and is being dismantled by labourers from far beyond Prayagraj.




One worker at a communal tent that housed 250 people a night says, as he and his co-workers pack up and reload their trucks, that they came from Mumbai – a roughly 860 mile (1,400km) journey – to set up and run the facility. They will take back everything they brought with them – including beds, chairs, electrical wiring and steel frames to hold up the tents.




Crowd control




As the Kumbh Mela’s temporary infrastructure pours out of Prayagraj, what happens to all the people? This year, more than 10 million participated in the final day of the festival alone. With such a massive crowd, disaster is always a threat, as when 36 people died in a stampede at the city’s main railway station on one of the busiest days of the 2013 event.




Many people came from villages across India, often making 10- or 12-hour journeys by train, road or on foot for a few minutes bathing at Sangam, the confluence of the Yamuna and Ganges rivers, where the water is believed to cleanse sins and release bathers from the cycle of rebirth.




As those pilgrims remaining in the city embark on their return trips, there is a feeling of anarchy in the streets. People pile on to the backs of trucks, filling them to the brim and spilling out over their edges. Others roam lost in the city, trying to locate the train station or find their cars.

Many would see this chaos as ordinary for a mega-event in India, and officials speak proudly of their performance. “This time we made the entrances and exits totally separate,” says Inspector Rajinder Kumar, who oversaw more than 3,000 police officers at the railway station on the festival’s final day. “That criss-cross movement was stopped and unauthorised entrances were blocked.”




Sanitation and the cleanliness of the city’s rivers was another key focus. In 2013 pollution levels in Sangam increased significantly after just the first day of the event, when 8 million people took holy dips. This year, extra water from barrages and dams upstream was released into the Ganges ahead of the start of the pilgrimage, to ensure a constant flow and avoid the stagnation that could lead to disease. Organisers say the efforts to keep the rivers clean are ongoing through the cleanup.




Dilip Trigunayak, one of the most senior officials at this year’s Kumbh, says that, as of mid-March, pollution levels in the water have remained within state Pollution Control Board limits.




Many locals say they have never before seen the water this clean. “It’s absolutely, unbelievably clean,” says Anil Agarwal, a lifelong resident of Prayagraj who ran a tent-city facility for pilgrims during the event. “If Sangam was dirty, all the filth would have come and collected at the shore. There’s been a big shift.”




For the prime minister, Narendra Modi, whose Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) was heavily involved in the Kumbh Mela, such reviews are helpful with a general election just weeks away. Modi and the BJP are supported by many of the Kumbh pilgrims, who see him as a strong leader who gets things done. A clean and well-run festival fits nicely into that narrative.

Critics, though, say that given much of the temporary city was erected on a part of Prayagraj’s riverbed, which is currently dry, the remaining rubbish could be washed into the river if it is not cleared before the tide changes this summer.




“It’s very ephemeral,” says the environmental activist Nityanand Jayaraman. “An intervention made to ease things for a little while. We’re used to substandard being normal, so when things improve marginally, by cleaning up water in one particular stretch, we are quite happy with that. It’s like cleaning up the beach before the governor visits.”




There are other signs that for all the talk of a “clean Kumbh”, the societal mindset changes required to achieve the government’s broader nationwide sanitation campaign are still far from complete.




Workers hired to clean toilets complain of the filth left behind and say some pilgrims steal their equipment. “They drove us crazy. We used to tie our hoses up but people would just open them and steal them,” says a toilet cleaner named Rahul.




Just down the street, Kumar, the garbage truck driver, empties a packet of chewing tobacco into his mouth and tosses the wrapper on the ground. Old habits clearly die hard, even for those leading the cleanup effort.




“You’re right, I shouldn’t have done that,” he says when challenged. “But we’ll pick it up later.”

Drawing millions of devotees and tourists, the two-month-long Maha Kumbh Mela festival is celebrated every 12 years on the banks of the Sangram, at the confluence of sacred Ganges and Yamuna rivers in India. But the Ganges River especially has been revered by Hindus to the point of extinction.




The Kumbh Mela custom is to bathe in these waters – a dip is in the Ganges, or Ganga, said to be a baptism for the soul; a sip is nectar to cleanse the body – even as more than a quarter-million gallons of raw sewage are pumped into the river every day, reports The National. Factories dump industrial waste into the river, which mixes with untreated sewage from cities with treatment plants unable to keep up with the waste produced by their booming populations.




For the near record 120 million Kumbh Mela bathers this year, Indian authorities opened a dam upstream to dilute toxins and ordered more than 1,000 tanneries to temporarily quit dumping arsenic and chromium run-off into the Ganges, according to the Financial Times.




Even so, the water doesn't begin to approach drinkability, and millions of bodies immersed in the river for what is thought to be the largest religious gathering in the world doesn't help. Devotees have staged hunger strikes to force the government to clean up the Ganges and halt proposed dams at its headwaters.

The report dated February 28 and uploaded on the tribunal’s website on March 7 said the board had conducted water monitoring twice a week from January 12 onwards, including on auspicious bathing days, at five locations on Ganga river and two locations on Yamuna river.




“There is a significant variability in the values on various parameters, viz pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and fecal coliform count (FC) for the samples taken from the same location on different dates. The values of the afore-mentioned parameters also vary at different locations for the samples collected on the same day,"" the report said.




The DO or the amount of oxygen in water, BOD, which measures the amount of oxygen needed to break down organic matter in water, and FC, a marker of sewage contamination, are key indicators of water quality.




The report said that an expert committee examined the issue of “variability in data"" and said that “the data represents a snapshot of water quality at a specific location and time and may vary significantly depending upon factors such as upstream anthropogenic activities (human actions), rate of flow, depth of sampling, time of sampling, river current and mixing of currents, sampling location and such other multiple factors"".




“As a result, these values reflect water quality parameters at the exact time and place from where these water samples were collected, and may not fully represent the overall characteristics of the river, therefore, not necessarily reflecting the overall river water quality throughout the river stretch,"" it said.

The report also said that because of the variability, a statistical analysis of water quality data of various monitoring locations for the key parameters was undertaken from January 12 to February 22 at 10 locations of “mass bathing"" and that 20 rounds of monitoring were done.




“It is submitted that as per the above-mentioned statistical analysis, the median value (central tendency of the data) of pH, DO, BOD and FC for the monitored stretches is within the respective criteria/permissible limits,"" the report noted.




According to the report, the median value for FC was 1,400 as compared to the permissible limit of 2,500 units per 100 ml, while the DO was 8.7 vis-a-vis the stipulated norm of being greater than 5 milligram per litre, and the BOD was 2.56 against the stipulated limit of less than or equal to 3 mg per litre.




On February 17, the CPCB had informed the tribunal through a report that various locations in Prayagraj during the Maha Kumbh were not conforming to the primary water quality for bathing with respect to the level of faecal coliform.




“The river water quality was not conforming to the primary water quality for bathing with respect to faecal coliform at all the monitored locations on various occasions.




“A large number of people bathe in the river at Prayagraj during the Maha Kumbh Mela, including on auspicious bathing days, which eventually leads to an increase in faecal concentration,"" the report had said.




At present, the matter has been posted for hearing on April 7. Advocate Saurabh Tiwari appeared for the petitioner in the case.

Citing a new report from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the government said key water quality indicators were within permissible limits for bathing.




Union Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav, responding to a question from Samajwadi Party MP Anand Bhadauria and Congress MP K Sudhakaran, stated, “According to the CPCB report, the median values of pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and faecal coliform (FC) at all monitored locations were within the permissible limits for bathing.”




DO measures the amount of oxygen in water, BOD assesses the oxygen needed to break down organic matter, and FC indicates sewage contamination — key metrics for determining water quality.




However, earlier reports had raised concerns. In a February 3 submission to the National Green Tribunal (NGT), the CPCB noted that water at several locations in Prayagraj did not meet the primary bathing water quality standard due to high faecal coliform levels.




In a subsequent report on February 28, the CPCB stated that statistical analysis confirmed the water quality during the Maha Kumbh was fit for bathing.




The report explained that due to ""variability of data"" from samples collected at different times and locations, individual readings did not fully reflect the ""overall river water quality throughout the river stretch.""




The CPCB carried out water quality monitoring at seven locations from January 12, covering key bathing days, and later expanded it to 10 locations with twice - daily testing from February 21. The monitoring included data from 10 sewage treatment plants (STPs) and seven geosynthetic dewatering tubes (geo-tubes) used for filtration.




The Uttar Pradesh government installed 10 STPs to treat wastewater, ensuring compliance with environmental standards before discharge into the Ganga.




Additionally, seven geo-tubes were deployed to manage wastewater from 21 untapped drains. Three prefabricated temporary STPs, each with a capacity of 500 kilolitres per day (KLD), and three faecal sludge treatment plants with a total capacity of 200 KLD were installed in the mela area. The UP Jal Nigam used advanced oxidation techniques to prevent untreated water from entering the river. Authorities also set up sufficient toilets, urinals, and dustbins to manage waste.




The CPCB report comes amid renewed criticism of river pollution. Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray recently questioned the cleanliness of the Ganga, claiming that none of India’s rivers were clean. Speaking at his party’s 19th foundation day event in Pune, he said, “I have seen several videos on social media about the state of the Ganga. I saw some people scratching and washing their bodies in the river.”




He added, “None of the rivers in India were clean. I have been hearing claims that ‘Ganga will be cleaned soon’ since Rajiv Gandhi was the prime minister. Now is the time to come out of this myth.”

https://thefederal.com/category/the-eighth-column/pollution-in-ganga-self-purification-of-ganga-prayagraj-174981,"Faith, filth and the myth: Pollution and self-purification of Ganges","In 1892, bacteriologist Ernest Hanbury Hankin arrived in Agra to take up the role of Chemical Examiner, Government Analyst, and Bacteriologist for the British Government's United Provinces, Punjab, and Central Provinces. His principal responsibility was to safeguard British troops from deadly illnesses, particularly the much-feared cholera.




To his great surprise, he saw that every morning, thousands of people were washing themselves, their animals, and their clothing in the unclean, cloudy waters of the Yamuna River. Typical of the colonial official, he believed the water was ""quite dangerous for consumption"" and that Hindus' ""veneration of these hallowed rivers demonstrated their lack of understanding of health and hygiene”.




A rude shock awaited him around the next corner. Just two years later, in February 1894, Allahabad hosted the Maagh Mela. Millions arrived for the holy dip and camped along the riverbank in Prayag. With half-burned bodies frequently making their last voyage in the river and millions bathing on the ghats, Hankin was sure that a huge cholera outbreak was on the way. His other colonial authorities believed the Ganges to be the primary channel for the propagation of the cholera epidemic.

Cholera did occasionally break out at a pilgrimage site, and because it is a waterborne disease, Hankin anticipated that the epidemic would spread to settlements farther downstream. To his amazement, cholera spread only when an infected pilgrim brought the illness back; otherwise, the villages downstream remained spared of the epidemic. He wondered, “How is this possible, given that cholera is transmitted by water? Can we presume that the river water does not carry the cholera germ?”




The curios case of Ganga




After studying medicine at the prestigious St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical School, he developed an interest in bacteriology and worked with Robert Koch in Berlin and Louis Pasteur in Paris before moving to India. His passion was in bacteriology.




Within the first two years of his visit, he noted that the native communities around the Ganges and Yamuna rivers were never afflicted with cholera by drinking water from them, despite cholera bacteria being regularly brought into these rivers by sewage. He was intrigued by the fact that not only were the waters of the Yamuna and Ganga drinkable, but they did not putrefy even when all of the settlements along the banks dumped their waste into the river. In contrast, all the major European rivers stank of human sewage and industrial pollution.




He was amazed that despite the pollution from huge towns and the habit of discarding half-burnt bodies into rivers, microorganisms and organic stuff could not live long in these river waters. While pandits and local hakims happily attributed it to the supernatural qualities of the holy Ganga, Hankin sought a scientific answer. Fazed by the riddle, he did what any reasonable scientist would do. He began a programme to carefully assess the water quality of the Ganga and Yamuna.




He gathered samples from Agra's sewers and discovered Vibrio cholerae, the cholera-causing bacteria. He also gathered samples from the river and wells along the banks and recorded which had cholera bacteria and which did not. However, even samples retrieved from the Yamuna and Ganga, a bit further away from the sewage outflow, were devoid of Vibrio cholerae bacteria, but water samples from the wells were teeming with them. He was astonished. He realised that some mechanism in the Ganga and Yamuna rivers prevented cholera germs from surviving.




When he tested with the samples, intentionally introducing the cholera pathogen, he discovered, to his astonishment, that ‘water of the Ganges kills the cholera germ in less than three hours’. He repeated the experiment, first filtering and then boiling the Ganges water. The filtered water still effectively killed the bacteria, but the germs in the boiled water survived and proliferated. Thus, he discovered that boiling weakened the Ganges water's potential to kill germs, but filtered and fresh water from the Ganges and Yamuna inhibited pathogen growth. He also found that, besides cholera, the Ganga and Yamuna rivers could restrict the growth of typhoid bacteria.




He concluded, ""I have not yet discovered the nature and origin of the antiseptic substance present in the waters of the Ganges and Jamuna rivers, what appears interesting is that they explain why cholera does not travel downstream rivers in India.""




Following these findings, Hankin advocated using river water rather than well water at Hindu pilgrimages such as the Kumbh Mela.




The legend




From the sixth century BCE, the Ganga-Yamuna Doab area emerged as a new cultural zone and political hub for various imperial dynasties, including the Mauryans, Guptas, Delhi sultans, and the Moghuls. These dynasties were connected with the Ganges valley, and political and commercial life revolved around the river. The river and its banks supported a large population, and its cultural significance cannot be overstated. Legends arose glorifying the heavenly attributes of the Ganga and its jal, underscoring its role in the lives of millions.




The sacred waters of the Ganges, known as Gangajal, are deeply revered in Indian culture. The Mahabharata states, ""As amrita is to the gods, so Ganga water is to human beings."" This profound comparison underscores the spiritual importance of the Ganges. According to Skanda Purāna's Gangasahasranaam, ""the medicated water of the Ganga, in sweetness, lightness and taste, has no equal, and that the water of this river, howsoever kept long, does not stink or spoil."" This cultural reverence for the Ganges is a testament to its unique properties and the role it plays in the lives of millions.




The Mughals felt enchanted by the ordinary people's veneration for the Ganga. Akbar created a new city near Prayag called Ilāh bās, the Abode of Gods, which the British misunderstood and corrupted as 'Allahabad'. Dr Ram Nath's book Private Lives of the Mughals states that Akbar stationed a trustworthy person at Ganga's banks to despatch Gangajal in sealed jars every day for drinking and cooking. Abul Fazl, a 16th-century chronicler, records Akbar's habits and says, ""His Majesty calls this source of life the water of immortality... Both at home and on his travels, he drinks Ganges water. Trustworthy persons stationed on the banks of the river dispatch the water in sealed jars.... Now that his majesty is in the Punjab, water is brought from Hardwar.""




The Ganga as it flows in Varanasi.




Hankin's conclusion that a mysterious, undiscovered form of life killed the pathogens and purified the Gangajal was published in the Annals of Pasteur Institute in 1896. This was first disregarded as folklore but later validated by several scientific studies. The Ganges somehow manage to cleanse itself. Hankin's discovery of antibacterial characteristics further reinforced the beliefs in the magical quality of the Gangajal, giving rise to the concept of Ganga's mystical 'self-purifying' potential.




What is the self-purification ability?




An old Slovenian saying encapsulates the heart of rivers' self-purification ability: “the water is cleansed when it runs over seven stones”. A complicated natural process comprising physical, chemical, and biological forces interweaves and purifies the contaminated river after a given amount of time.




Dilution is one of the primary purifying processes. When wastewater is released into a fast-flowing and turbulent watercourse, the ratio of stream discharge to pollution discharge increases, effectively purifying the water. Similarly, the hyporheic zone of a riverbed, consisting of gravel and sand, functions as a sieve, sifting minute particles of organic waste or inorganic material and successfully attaching them to the clay in the riverbed, eliminating contaminants in the flowing water.




Domestic sewage, including organic contaminants, is a major pollutant that reaches waterways. These are frequently hydrolysed, which means they are chemically broken down by an interaction with water, converting and destroying the contaminants. Photolysis is a method that uses light to break down some contaminants. Chemical processes are frequently linked to physical processes; hence, they are referred to as “physical-chemical processes”.




Although physical-chemical processes contribute to purification, biological activities are critical to river water's self-purification ability, which relies heavily on the population of organisms that dwell there. Decomposers are microbes that operate directly to degrade and decompose contaminants into basic components and mineral compounds, a process known as mineralisation. Animals and plants then ingest these degraded minerals as nourishment and incorporate them into their bodies. A complex interaction of many life forms aids in the conversion of polluting organic wastes in rivers into nutrients for the ecosystem of species that dwell there.




Ganga’s secret: A tiny virus and the mighty Himalayas




But what is the secret of the Ganga's self-cleansing properties? It took several years until Frederick W. Twort and Félix d'Hérelle identified a new kind of virus, known as bacteriophages or bacteria eater. Subsequent research revealed that the Ganges contained more of these bacteriophages, natural bacterial predators. Just as viral infections, such as COVID-19, may be fatal to humans, infected bacteria commonly die. Thousands of bacteriophage species have been discovered in the Ganges, which helps to keep bacterial growth in check. Ganges' unique biological defence mechanism contributes significantly to its purifying ability.

Interestingly, a recent study discovered the existence of bacteriophages against harmful bacteria in the Ganges waters, even near its source at Gomukh. Meltwater streaming from the Himalayan permafrost carried phages that killed Escherichia bacterium species, including pathogenic E. Coli. The researchers hypothesise that these bacteriophage viruses were locked in the Himalayan permafrost as abiotic particles millions of years ago and that when the glaciers thaw, they get activated in the meltwater.




The discovery of bacteriophages and bacterium predators helped to unravel some of the enigma. However, this alone cannot explain the Ganges' ability to purify itself. The second mechanism was discovered on the slopes of the mighty Himalayas.




The Himalayas are the world's highest, youngest, and most active continental mountain system. They were formed just 50 million years ago and continue evolving, rising by about 1 cm yearly. Rainwater often contains dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2), making it somewhat acidic. When this mildly acidic rain falls on the young Himalayan calcium-bearing silicate rocks, a chemical reaction occurs, forming limestone and leaching of silicate and other ionic minerals.




Because the Himalayas are young and constantly rising, new rock surfaces are exposed, resulting in significant rates of silicate leaching and chemical denudation. For example, the Ganga depletes almost 72 tonnes per km per year, nearly two to two and a half times the global average. The Ganga-Brahmaputra river system carries around 130 million tonnes of dissolved salts to the Bay of Bengal, accounting for almost 3% of the total world river flux to the oceans.




The silicates and metallic ions dissolve in runoff water and enter streams and rivulets that flow into the Ganges, where they are carried downstream. The transported silicates settle and adhere to the clay at the river's bottom, and the leached metallic minerals become entrenched in the riverbed clay.




River water is a chemical soup of dissolved minerals constantly subjected to complicated physicochemical and biological processes. Metal ions in this soup inhibit the growth of bacteria by adhering to their surfaces and limiting pathogen proliferation. This is also a crucial mechanism for purifying Ganges river water.




Limits to self-cleansing




As with all natural processes, there is a limit beyond which the natural mechanism falters. Self-purification can only be effective if the volume of wastewater does not exceed a river's natural ability to clean itself. The two chief reasons for their incapacity to clean themselves are human-made synthetic pollutants and sewage, which far exceeds the self-purification capability of natural systems.




The river's flow allows oxygen from the atmosphere to dissolve in the river ecosystems. Aquatic vegetation and plankton, a type of microbe, create food through photosynthesis, releasing oxygen, some of which dissolve and refill the oxygen supply for the intricate web of aquatic life. Adequate dissolved oxygen in the river water is required for complete purification, meaning all organic stuff is degraded and mineralised.




When there is a dearth of dissolved oxygen, the system becomes choked. The decomposers are unable to metabolise dead materials, and mineralisation is incomplete, resulting in a shortage of nutrients for growth. Poor vegetation growth further reduces the levels of dissolved oxygen. Further, partially decomposed organic molecules breakdown into methane and hydrogen sulphide, which have a galling stench. The river gradually deteriorated and became unable to rejuvenate itself.




Ganges in trouble




Two processes undermine and restrict Ganga's potential to renew. When the tributaries converge to create the Ganga, they transport dissolved silicate. However, sewage and industrial contaminants in the upper reaches bind to these silicates and metallic ions, leaving nothing when the river reaches its mid-course. By the time Ganga reaches Gomti, the silicate concentration has decreased. This diminishes the availability of metallic ions in Ganga, which is needed to suppress pathogen populations.




Various investigations have revealed an abundance of bacteriophages. Ironically, it is not a source of pride that bacteriophages exist in higher numbers because this suggests that their prey, bacteria, is abundant. Simply put, a higher number of bacteria-killing viruses implies bacterial infection. Organic sewage stimulates the growth of bacteria, overwhelming the bacteriophage. Hence, larger quantities of bacteriophages do not indicate the river's vitality or virility but rather its death and decay.




Alarmingly, research released in June 2020 on the numerous and broad range of phages discovered antibiotic resistance genes in India's Ganga River. This highlights the massive public health concern looming over the Gangetic plains and warns that the health of Ganga is deteriorating.




Earlier studies




Ganga is admired as India's holy river, and bathing in it is considered a source of salvation; hence, pilgrims assemble for a dip at several points throughout Ganga's course and during the Kumbh or Maha-Kumbh festival. The large crowds at the Kumbh just exacerbate the problem.




During the previous Kumbh, scientific studies were conducted to assess the impact of mass bathing. For example, a study led by Sanjay Dwivedi of the CSIR-National Botanical Research Institute examined changes in physicochemical properties, microbial diversity, and the role of bacteriophages in controlling the bacterial population of Ganga water during mass ritualistic bathing during the 2013 Maha-Kumbh festival. The Maha-Kumbh saw a significant rise in biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), hardness, total dissolved solids (TDS), and ion levels. In contrast, dissolved oxygen levels in Ganga waters decreased.




BOD measures the quantity of oxygen microorganisms utilise when breaking down organic materials in water over time. It indicates the level of organic pollution in water and points to untreated sewage discharges. COD measures the amount of oxygen utilised to chemically oxidise organic and inorganic molecules, and it is widely used to analyse industrial pollution. Less dissolved oxygen harms the fish and other animals that reside in the river. The authors concluded that the increased pollution load exceeded its self-cleaning characteristics.




After evaluating data from the 2019 Kumbh Mela, the Central Pollution Control Board published a paper titled 'Environmental Footprints of Mass Bathing on Water Quality of River Ganga during Kumbh Mela'. The analysis indicated that at various ghats during the Kumbh Mela, levels of Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) and faecal coliform in the Ganga River surpassed tolerable limits, indicating severe water pollution from mass bathing. With an estimated 13.02 crore people participating, the strain on the Ganges was substantially higher; imagine what it will be like when the number of participants increases dramatically this time?




Anviksiki




For many believers, taking a dip in the Ganga during the Kumbh is a matter of faith. Examining the pollution levels in the Ganges is not an affront to their religious belief but rather a concern for their safety and the river's well-being. Closing our eyes to the realities of contamination will not make it go away.




Unfortunately, in recent months, any mention of pollution related to the Mahakumbh has sparked fierce discord and vexing competitive victimhood; why only us? They also clean their face and legs in a community pool before praying. Then comes a scientist, brandishing publications and saying that the Ganga has self-purifying properties, certifying it as the world's cleanest river. Accusations are traded, tempers boil, and reason takes a backseat.




Kautilya says in Arthasastra-




pradīpaḥ sarvavidyānāmupāyaḥ sarvakarmaṇām |




āśrayaḥ sarvadharmāṇāṃ śaśvadānvīkṣikī matā ||




The study of critical inquiry is always considered a lamp for all branches of knowledge, a means in all activities, and a support for all religious and social duty.




Further he adds,




dharmādharmau trayyāmarthānarthau vārttāyāṃ nayānayau daṇḍanītyāṃ balābale ca etāsāṃ hetubhiranvīkṣamāṇā lokasya upakaroti vyasane'bhyudaye ca buddhimavasthāpayati prajñāvākyakriyāvaiśāradyaṃ ca karoti




Investigating by means of reasons, good and evil in the Vedic religion, profit and loss in the field of trade and agriculture, and prudent and imprudent policy in political administration, as well as their relative strengths and weaknesses, the study of critical inquiry (anviksiki) confers benefit on people, keeps their minds steady in adversity and in prosperity, and produces adeptness of understanding, speech and action.




Flagging the worrisome pollution levels does not restrict believers' right to fulfil religious duties or take a pilgrimage. If we want to commemorate Ganga and the piety of millions, we must prioritise critical inquiry, anviksiki, as advocated by Kautilya, and find ways to arrest the deterioration of the river ecosystem.




During this Kumbh, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) gathered samples and revealed frightening results. Let us focus on one aspect — Faecal coliform levels. Coliforms are bacteria found in warm-blooded animals' intestines, including humans. Faecal coliform bacteria are associated with human or animal waste. Elevated levels of faecal coliform are a symptom of sewage pollution. The permissible limit of faecal coliform in bath water is 2,500 units per 100 mL, while the desirable level is 500 MPN/100 mL. However, according to CPCB records (http://103.7.181.103:4000/), values were exceeded on several occasions and in multiple locations, reaching frightening levels as high as 23000, 30000, and even 50,000.




This plainly shows that the human sewage disposal from the mass gathering contaminated the river, and whatever process was put in place to purify the human excreta before dumping it into the river did not succeed. A systematic analysis of pollutant profiles, identifying the sources of contamination, and devising a strategy to stop them necessitates reasonable and scientific investigation.",Indian,The Federal,"In 1892, bacteriologist Ernest Hanbury Hankin arrived in Agra to take up the role of Chemical Examiner, Government Analyst, and Bacteriologist for the British Government's United Provinces, Punjab, and Central Provinces.

Can we presume that the river water does not carry the cholera germ?” The curios case of Ganga After studying medicine at the prestigious St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical School, he developed an interest in bacteriology and worked with Robert Koch in Berlin and Louis Pasteur in Paris before moving to India. His passion was in bacteriology. Within the first two years of his visit, he noted that the native communities around the Ganges and Yamuna rivers were never afflicted with cholera by drinking water from them, despite cholera bacteria being regularly brought into these rivers by sewage. He was intrigued by the fact that not only were the waters of the Yamuna and Ganga drinkable, but they did not putrefy even when all of the settlements along the banks dumped their waste into the river. In contrast, all the major European rivers stank of human sewage and industrial pollution. He was amazed that despite the pollution from huge towns and the habit of discarding half-burnt bodies into rivers, microorganisms and organic stuff could not live long in these river waters. While pandits and local hakims happily attributed it to the supernatural qualities of the holy Ganga, Hankin sought a scientific answer. Fazed by the riddle, he did what any reasonable scientist would do. He began a programme to carefully assess the water quality of the Ganga and Yamuna. He gathered samples from Agra's sewers and discovered Vibrio cholerae, the cholera-causing bacteria. He also gathered samples from the river and wells along the banks and recorded which had cholera bacteria and which did not. However, even samples retrieved from the Yamuna and Ganga, a bit further away from the sewage outflow, were devoid of Vibrio cholerae bacteria, but water samples from the wells were teeming with them. He was astonished. He realised that some mechanism in the Ganga and Yamuna rivers prevented cholera germs from surviving. When he tested with the samples, intentionally introducing the cholera pathogen, he discovered, to his astonishment, that ‘water of the Ganges kills the cholera germ in less than three hours’. He repeated the experiment, first filtering and then boiling the Ganges water. The filtered water still effectively killed the bacteria, but the germs in the boiled water survived and proliferated. Thus, he discovered that boiling weakened the Ganges water's potential to kill germs, but filtered and fresh water from the Ganges and Yamuna inhibited pathogen growth. He also found that, besides cholera, the Ganga and Yamuna rivers could restrict the growth of typhoid bacteria. He concluded, ""I have not yet discovered the nature and origin of the antiseptic substance present in the waters of the Ganges and Jamuna rivers, what appears interesting is that they explain why cholera does not travel downstream rivers in India."" Following these findings, Hankin advocated using river water rather than well water at Hindu pilgrimages such as the Kumbh Mela. The legend From the sixth century BCE, the Ganga-Yamuna Doab area emerged as a new cultural zone and political hub for various imperial dynasties, including the Mauryans, Guptas, Delhi sultans, and the Moghuls. These dynasties were connected with the Ganges valley, and political and commercial life revolved around the river. The river and its banks supported a large population, and its cultural significance cannot be overstated. Legends arose glorifying the heavenly attributes of the Ganga and its jal, underscoring its role in the lives of millions. The sacred waters of the Ganges, known as Gangajal, are deeply revered in Indian culture. The Mahabharata states, ""As amrita is to the gods, so Ganga water is to human beings."" This profound comparison underscores the spiritual importance of the Ganges. According to Skanda Purāna's Gangasahasranaam, ""the medicated water of the Ganga, in sweetness, lightness and taste, has no equal, and that the water of this river, howsoever kept long, does not stink or spoil."" This cultural reverence for the Ganges is a testament to its unique properties and the role it plays in the lives of millions. The Mughals felt enchanted by the ordinary people's veneration for the Ganga. Akbar created a new city near Prayag called Ilāh bās, the Abode of Gods, which the British misunderstood and corrupted as 'Allahabad'. Dr Ram Nath's book Private Lives of the Mughals states that Akbar stationed a trustworthy person at Ganga's banks to despatch Gangajal in sealed jars every day for drinking and cooking. Abul Fazl, a 16th-century chronicler, records Akbar's habits and says, ""His Majesty calls this source of life the water of immortality... Both at home and on his travels, he drinks Ganges water. Trustworthy persons stationed on the banks of the river dispatch the water in sealed jars.... Now that his majesty is in the Punjab, water is brought from Hardwar."" The Ganga as it flows in Varanasi. Hankin's conclusion that a mysterious, undiscovered form of life killed the pathogens and purified the Gangajal was published in the Annals of Pasteur Institute in 1896. This was first disregarded as folklore but later validated by several scientific studies. The Ganges somehow manage to cleanse itself. Hankin's discovery of antibacterial characteristics further reinforced the beliefs in the magical quality of the Gangajal, giving rise to the concept of Ganga's mystical 'self-purifying' potential. What is the self-purification ability? An old Slovenian saying encapsulates the heart of rivers' self-purification ability: “the water is cleansed when it runs over seven stones”. A complicated natural process comprising physical, chemical, and biological forces interweaves and purifies the contaminated river after a given amount of time. Dilution is one of the primary purifying processes. When wastewater is released into a fast-flowing and turbulent watercourse, the ratio of stream discharge to pollution discharge increases, effectively purifying the water. Similarly, the hyporheic zone of a riverbed, consisting of gravel and sand, functions as a sieve, sifting minute particles of organic waste or inorganic material and successfully attaching them to the clay in the riverbed, eliminating contaminants in the flowing water. Domestic sewage, including organic contaminants, is a major pollutant that reaches waterways. These are frequently hydrolysed, which means they are chemically broken down by an interaction with water, converting and destroying the contaminants. Photolysis is a method that uses light to break down some contaminants. Chemical processes are frequently linked to physical processes; hence, they are referred to as “physical-chemical processes”. Although physical-chemical processes contribute to purification, biological activities are critical to river water's self-purification ability, which relies heavily on the population of organisms that dwell there. Decomposers are microbes that operate directly to degrade and decompose contaminants into basic components and mineral compounds, a process known as mineralisation. Animals and plants then ingest these degraded minerals as nourishment and incorporate them into their bodies. A complex interaction of many life forms aids in the conversion of polluting organic wastes in rivers into nutrients for the ecosystem of species that dwell there. Ganga’s secret: A tiny virus and the mighty Himalayas But what is the secret of the Ganga's self-cleansing properties? It took several years until Frederick W. Twort and Félix d'Hérelle identified a new kind of virus, known as bacteriophages or bacteria eater. Subsequent research revealed that the Ganges contained more of these bacteriophages, natural bacterial predators. Just as viral infections, such as COVID-19, may be fatal to humans, infected bacteria commonly die. Thousands of bacteriophage species have been discovered in the Ganges, which helps to keep bacterial growth in check. Ganges' unique biological defence mechanism contributes significantly to its purifying ability. Also read | Maha Kumbh's grand finale Interestingly, a recent study discovered the existence of bacteriophages against harmful bacteria in the Ganges waters, even near its source at Gomukh. Meltwater streaming from the Himalayan permafrost carried phages that killed Escherichia bacterium species, including pathogenic E. Coli. The researchers hypothesise that these bacteriophage viruses were locked in the Himalayan permafrost as abiotic particles millions of years ago and that when the glaciers thaw, they get activated in the meltwater. The discovery of bacteriophages and bacterium predators helped to unravel some of the enigma. However, this alone cannot explain the Ganges' ability to purify itself. The second mechanism was discovered on the slopes of the mighty Himalayas. The Himalayas are the world's highest, youngest, and most active continental mountain system. They were formed just 50 million years ago and continue evolving, rising by about 1 cm yearly. Rainwater often contains dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2), making it somewhat acidic. When this mildly acidic rain falls on the young Himalayan calcium-bearing silicate rocks, a chemical reaction occurs, forming limestone and leaching of silicate and other ionic minerals. Because the Himalayas are young and constantly rising, new rock surfaces are exposed, resulting in significant rates of silicate leaching and chemical denudation. For example, the Ganga depletes almost 72 tonnes per km per year, nearly two to two and a half times the global average. The Ganga-Brahmaputra river system carries around 130 million tonnes of dissolved salts to the Bay of Bengal, accounting for almost 3% of the total world river flux to the oceans. The silicates and metallic ions dissolve in runoff water and enter streams and rivulets that flow into the Ganges, where they are carried downstream. The transported silicates settle and adhere to the clay at the river's bottom, and the leached metallic minerals become entrenched in the riverbed clay. River water is a chemical soup of dissolved minerals constantly subjected to complicated physicochemical and biological processes. Metal ions in this soup inhibit the growth of bacteria by adhering to their surfaces and limiting pathogen proliferation. This is also a crucial mechanism for purifying Ganges river water. Limits to self-cleansing As with all natural processes, there is a limit beyond which the natural mechanism falters. Self-purification can only be effective if the volume of wastewater does not exceed a river's natural ability to clean itself. The two chief reasons for their incapacity to clean themselves are human-made synthetic pollutants and sewage, which far exceeds the self-purification capability of natural systems. The river's flow allows oxygen from the atmosphere to dissolve in the river ecosystems. Aquatic vegetation and plankton, a type of microbe, create food through photosynthesis, releasing oxygen, some of which dissolve and refill the oxygen supply for the intricate web of aquatic life. Adequate dissolved oxygen in the river water is required for complete purification, meaning all organic stuff is degraded and mineralised. When there is a dearth of dissolved oxygen, the system becomes choked. The decomposers are unable to metabolise dead materials, and mineralisation is incomplete, resulting in a shortage of nutrients for growth. Poor vegetation growth further reduces the levels of dissolved oxygen. Further, partially decomposed organic molecules breakdown into methane and hydrogen sulphide, which have a galling stench. The river gradually deteriorated and became unable to rejuvenate itself. Ganges in trouble Two processes undermine and restrict Ganga's potential to renew. When the tributaries converge to create the Ganga, they transport dissolved silicate. However, sewage and industrial contaminants in the upper reaches bind to these silicates and metallic ions, leaving nothing when the river reaches its mid-course. By the time Ganga reaches Gomti, the silicate concentration has decreased. This diminishes the availability of metallic ions in Ganga, which is needed to suppress pathogen populations. Various investigations have revealed an abundance of bacteriophages. Ironically, it is not a source of pride that bacteriophages exist in higher numbers because this suggests that their prey, bacteria, is abundant. Simply put, a higher number of bacteria-killing viruses implies bacterial infection. Organic sewage stimulates the growth of bacteria, overwhelming the bacteriophage. Hence, larger quantities of bacteriophages do not indicate the river's vitality or virility but rather its death and decay. Alarmingly, research released in June 2020 on the numerous and broad range of phages discovered antibiotic resistance genes in India's Ganga River. This highlights the massive public health concern looming over the Gangetic plains and warns that the health of Ganga is deteriorating. Earlier studies Ganga is admired as India's holy river, and bathing in it is considered a source of salvation; hence, pilgrims assemble for a dip at several points throughout Ganga's course and during the Kumbh or Maha-Kumbh festival. The large crowds at the Kumbh just exacerbate the problem. During the previous Kumbh, scientific studies were conducted to assess the impact of mass bathing. For example, a study led by Sanjay Dwivedi of the CSIR-National Botanical Research Institute examined changes in physicochemical properties, microbial diversity, and the role of bacteriophages in controlling the bacterial population of Ganga water during mass ritualistic bathing during the 2013 Maha-Kumbh festival. The Maha-Kumbh saw a significant rise in biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), hardness, total dissolved solids (TDS), and ion levels. In contrast, dissolved oxygen levels in Ganga waters decreased. BOD measures the quantity of oxygen microorganisms utilise when breaking down organic materials in water over time. It indicates the level of organic pollution in water and points to untreated sewage discharges. COD measures the amount of oxygen utilised to chemically oxidise organic and inorganic molecules, and it is widely used to analyse industrial pollution. Less dissolved oxygen harms the fish and other animals that reside in the river. The authors concluded that the increased pollution load exceeded its self-cleaning characteristics. After evaluating data from the 2019 Kumbh Mela, the Central Pollution Control Board published a paper titled 'Environmental Footprints of Mass Bathing on Water Quality of River Ganga during Kumbh Mela'. The analysis indicated that at various ghats during the Kumbh Mela, levels of Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) and faecal coliform in the Ganga River surpassed tolerable limits, indicating severe water pollution from mass bathing. With an estimated 13.02 crore people participating, the strain on the Ganges was substantially higher; imagine what it will be like when the number of participants increases dramatically this time? Anviksiki For many believers, taking a dip in the Ganga during the Kumbh is a matter of faith. Examining the pollution levels in the Ganges is not an affront to their religious belief but rather a concern for their safety and the river's well-being. Closing our eyes to the realities of contamination will not make it go away. Unfortunately, in recent months, any mention of pollution related to the Mahakumbh has sparked fierce discord and vexing competitive victimhood; why only us? They also clean their face and legs in a community pool before praying. Then comes a scientist, brandishing publications and saying that the Ganga has self-purifying properties, certifying it as the world's cleanest river. Accusations are traded, tempers boil, and reason takes a backseat. Kautilya says in Arthasastra- pradīpaḥ sarvavidyānāmupāyaḥ sarvakarmaṇām | āśrayaḥ sarvadharmāṇāṃ śaśvadānvīkṣikī matā || The study of critical inquiry is always considered a lamp for all branches of knowledge, a means in all activities, and a support for all religious and social duty. Further he adds, dharmādharmau trayyāmarthānarthau vārttāyāṃ nayānayau daṇḍanītyāṃ balābale ca etāsāṃ hetubhiranvīkṣamāṇā lokasya upakaroti vyasane'bhyudaye ca buddhimavasthāpayati prajñāvākyakriyāvaiśāradyaṃ ca karoti Investigating by means of reasons, good and evil in the Vedic religion, profit and loss in the field of trade and agriculture, and prudent and imprudent policy in political administration, as well as their relative strengths and weaknesses, the study of critical inquiry (anviksiki) confers benefit on people, keeps their minds steady in adversity and in prosperity, and produces adeptness of understanding, speech and action. Flagging the worrisome pollution levels does not restrict believers' right to fulfil religious duties or take a pilgrimage. If we want to commemorate Ganga and the piety of millions, we must prioritise critical inquiry, anviksiki, as advocated by Kautilya, and find ways to arrest the deterioration of the river ecosystem. During this Kumbh, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) gathered samples and revealed frightening results. Let us focus on one aspect — Faecal coliform levels. Coliforms are bacteria found in warm-blooded animals' intestines, including humans. Faecal coliform bacteria are associated with human or animal waste. Elevated levels of faecal coliform are a symptom of sewage pollution. The permissible limit of faecal coliform in bath water is 2,500 units per 100 mL, while the desirable level is 500 MPN/100 mL. However, according to CPCB records ( values were exceeded on several occasions and in multiple locations, reaching frightening levels as high as 23000, 30000, and even 50,000. This plainly shows that the human sewage disposal from the mass gathering contaminated the river, and whatever process was put in place to purify the human excreta before dumping it into the river did not succeed. A systematic analysis of pollutant profiles, identifying the sources of contamination, and devising a strategy to stop them necessitates reasonable and scientific investigation.",Belief Aligned,0.3254749775,0.3578111827,0.31671381,Critical of Government,0.3548395038,0.413556546,0.2316039801

The principal bench of National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed the State authorities to ensure that water quality of Ganga-Yamuna rivers for pilgrims of Kumbh mela which is to be organized in 2024-25 at Uttar Pradesh's Prayraj is maintained to the level of drinking water quality.




Chairperson Justice Prakash Shrivastava, Justice Arun Kumar Tyagi and Dr. A. Senthil Vel while granting eight weeks time to the State for filing progress report, directed that, ""The concerned Authorities will ensure that the water quality of rivers is maintained to the level of drinking quality and its suitability is displayed to pilgrims/visitors of the Kumbh Mela at various bathing ghats.""




The Tribunal was hearing an application raising grievances related to discharge of sewage into the river Ganga and Yamuna and the consequential pollution in the River especially in reference to the Kumbh Mela which is to be organized in 2024-25.




In pursuance of NGT's previous direction the joint Committee filed a report containing the details of the untapped drains joining river Ganga and Yamuna, the details of the tapped drains, STPs with their capacity utilization, the sewage network and the gap analysis.




Perusing the report the Tribunal noted, ""there are as many as 44 untapped drains which are discharging untreated sewage water in river Ganga. The report further reveals that there are total 81 drains in the city and these 81 drains are discharging 289.97 MLD of sewage and that the sewage received through sewerage network in the existing 10 STPs is 178.31 MLD. The untapped drains are discharging 73.80 MLD and the gap in the treatment capacity is 128.28 MLD.""




It noted further that, the report does not reflect that during the forthcoming Kumbh Mela any effective progress will be made ""to prevent the discharge of 73.80 MLD untreated sewage in river Ganga through the untapped drains which are 44 in number.""




While pointing out several shortcomings in the report, the Tribunal said, ""Having regard to the fact that pilgrims/visitors of the Kumbh Mela will be taking bath in river Ganga/Yamuna and will be using their water for drinking etc. we are of the view that all possible effective and expeditious steps are required to be taken and a time bound action plan is required to be prepared to ensure minimum discharge/stoppage of discharge of sewage in river Ganga/Yamuna before the commencement of the Kumbh Mela.""




In the light of the above, NGT granted further eight weeks' time to the UP government to file a further report reflecting the progress.




The matter is listed for September 23, for further consideration.

The central government on Monday cited a new report from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in Parliament and said the water in the Ganga at Triveni Sangam in Prayagraj was fit for bathing during the recently concluded Maha Kumbh.




Triveni Sangam is where the Ganga meets the Yamuna and Saraswati rivers. The government also said it had provided a total of Rs 7,421 crore to the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) for cleaning the river in 2022-23, 2023-24 and 2024-25 (until March 9).In response to a question from Samajwadi Party MP Anand Bhadauria and Congress MP K Sudhakaran, Union Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav said that according to the CPCB report, the median values of pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and faecal coliform (FC) at all monitored locations were within the permissible limits for bathing.

DO refers to the amount of oxygen in water, BOD measures the oxygen needed to break down organic matter and FC is an indicator of sewage contamination. These are key indicators of water quality.In a report dated February 3, the CPCB had informed the National Green Tribunal (NGT) that water at several locations in Prayagraj during the Maha Kumbh did not meet the primary bathing water quality standard due to high faecal coliform levels.However, in a new report submitted to the tribunal on February 28, the CPCB said statistical analysis showed that the water quality during the Maha Kumbh was fit for bathing.




The report said that the statistical analysis was necessary due to the ”variability of data” in samples collected from the same locations on different dates and even from different spots on the same day. This variability meant the samples did not fully reflect the ”overall river water quality throughout the river stretch”, it said.In the case of ”Kamlesh Singh vs State of Uttar Pradesh & Others”, the NGT had on December 23, 2024 directed that water quality monitoring of the Ganga and Yamuna should be conducted regularly at frequent intervals during the Maha Kumbh to ensure compliance with primary water quality criteria.Yadav said that in response to this order, the CPCB carried out water quality monitoring at seven locations twice a week, from Shringverpur Ghat (upstream of Prayagraj) to Deehaghat (downstream), including at Sangam nose (where the Ganga and the Yamuna meet).




Monitoring began on January 12 and covered auspicious bathing (Amrit Snan) days.The CPCB submitted its initial monitoring report to the NGT on February 3, which included water quality data collected between January 12 and 26, 2025. The report also included monitoring data from 10 sewage treatment plants (STPs) installed in Prayagraj and seven geosynthetic dewatering tubes (geo-tubes) used for filtration, Yadav said.Later, the CPCB increased the number of monitoring locations to 10 and began testing twice daily from February 21 to improve water quality data availability.The minister said the Uttar Pradesh government installed 10 STPs for the Maha Kumbh to treat wastewater, ensuring that effluents met environmental standards before being released.




Also, seven geo-tubes were installed as a temporary solution to treat wastewater from 21 untapped drains.Three prefabricated temporary STPs, each with a capacity of 500 kilolitres per day (KLD) and three faecal sludge treatment plants with a total capacity of 200 KLD were installed in the mela area.Yadav said the UP Jal Nigam used advanced oxidation techniques to treat wastewater and prevent untreated water from entering the Ganga.A sufficient number of toilets and urinals were set up across the mela area to accommodate the large number of pilgrims. Dustbins with liner bags were also placed strategically for waste disposal, he said.",Indian,Money Control,"Triveni Sangam is where the Ganga meets the Yamuna and Saraswati rivers.

These are key indicators of water quality.In a report dated February 3, the CPCB had informed the National Green Tribunal (NGT) that water at several locations in Prayagraj during the Maha Kumbh did not meet the primary bathing water quality standard due to high faecal coliform levels.However, in a new report submitted to the tribunal on February 28, the CPCB said statistical analysis showed that the water quality during the Maha Kumbh was fit for bathing. The report said that the statistical analysis was necessary due to the ”variability of data” in samples collected from the same locations on different dates and even from different spots on the same day. This variability meant the samples did not fully reflect the ”overall river water quality throughout the river stretch”, it said.In the case of ”Kamlesh Singh vs State of Uttar Pradesh & Others”, the NGT had on December 23, 2024 directed that water quality monitoring of the Ganga and Yamuna should be conducted regularly at frequent intervals during the Maha Kumbh to ensure compliance with primary water quality criteria.Yadav said that in response to this order, the CPCB carried out water quality monitoring at seven locations twice a week, from Shringverpur Ghat (upstream of Prayagraj) to Deehaghat (downstream), including at Sangam nose (where the Ganga and the Yamuna meet). Monitoring began on January 12 and covered auspicious bathing (Amrit Snan) days.The CPCB submitted its initial monitoring report to the NGT on February 3, which included water quality data collected between January 12 and 26, 2025. The report also included monitoring data from 10 sewage treatment plants (STPs) installed in Prayagraj and seven geosynthetic dewatering tubes (geo-tubes) used for filtration, Yadav said.Later, the CPCB increased the number of monitoring locations to 10 and began testing twice daily from February 21 to improve water quality data availability.The minister said the Uttar Pradesh government installed 10 STPs for the Maha Kumbh to treat wastewater, ensuring that effluents met environmental standards before being released. Also, seven geo-tubes were installed as a temporary solution to treat wastewater from 21 untapped drains.Three prefabricated temporary STPs, each with a capacity of 500 kilolitres per day (KLD) and three faecal sludge treatment plants with a total capacity of 200 KLD were installed in the mela area.Yadav said the UP Jal Nigam used advanced oxidation techniques to treat wastewater and prevent untreated water from entering the Ganga.A sufficient number of toilets and urinals were set up across the mela area to accommodate the large number of pilgrims. Dustbins with liner bags were also placed strategically for waste disposal, he said.",Belief Aligned,0.375222683,0.4600625038,0.164714843,Pro-Government,0.4516371787,0.3890443444,0.1593184918

Union Carbide waste: Third and final disposal trial ends




The third and final incineration trial of hazardous waste from Union Carbide Bhopal factory ended Wednesday at ReSustainability’s waste disposal facility at Pithampur, Madhya Pradesh, reported the Indian Express citing Pollution Control Board. A total of 30 tonnes of the 337 metric tonnes of hazardous waste transported from the Union Carbide factory in Bhopal to Pithampur in early January was incinerated starting February 28, the newspaper reported. The emissions of pollutants and gases monitored for all trials were within prescribed limits as per MPPCB’s continuous monitoring.




On December 3, the court had directed the Bhopal Gas Tragedy Relief and Rehabilitation Department to clean up Union Carbide factory site and take all remedial steps for removal and safe disposal of the waste from the area concerned.




Yamuna River ‘virtually non-existent’ in Delhi, says parliamentary panel report




The Yamuna River is “virtually non-existent” in Delhi and even if the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) treats all its sewage it would still stay polluted due to the lack of freshwater flow downstream of Wazirabad, Indian Express reported citing parliamentary standing committee findings. The panel’s report ‘Review of Upper Yamuna River Cleaning Project Up to Delhi and River Bed Management in Delhi’ was tabled in Parliament.




The panel noted that the river was “virtually non-existent” in Delhi due to insufficient dissolved oxygen levels “which indicate whether the river is alive or not”. For years the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) and the Irrigation and Flood Control Department, and centre have focused on capacity of sewage treatment plants (STPs) and common effluent treatment plants but the key concern of maintaining an adequate environmental flow remains unaddressed, the committee’s findings revealed.




The panel observed that “there is almost nil environmental flow available at downstream of Wazirabad Barrage during 9 out of 12 months in a year…”.




The National Institute of Hydrology (NIH) had recommended increasing the e-flow to 23 cumecs in the lean season, but the Haryana government had refused citing the 1994 inter-state water-sharing agreement which is to be reviewed after 2025. The panel found that 23 out of 33 locations on Yamuna River (six in Haryana and Delhi each, and 11 in Uttar Pradesh) are not suitable for bathing. The panel recommended controlled dredging to resolve the issue of the presence of heavy metals like lead, copper, zinc, nickel, cadmium and chromium in the Yamuna riverbed. The panel noted there was lack of data on the unauthorised industries operating in Delhi as well as the pollution caused by open pyres (only one electric/CNG crematorium exists near Yamuna’s banks).




Delhi continues to be most polluted capital; 13 out of 20 most polluted cities found in India




The World Air Quality Report 2024 by Swiss air quality technology firm IQAir revealed that 13 of the world’s 20 most polluted cities are located in India, with Byrnihat in Meghalaya claiming the top spot, DTE reported. The report added that Delhi continues to hold the title of the most polluted capital city globally. India has been ranked as the fifth most polluted country in 2024, a slight improvement from its third-place position in 2023. India experienced a 7% reduction in PM2.5 concentrations in 2024, with levels averaging 50.6 micrograms per cubic metre, down from 54.4 micrograms per cubic metre in 2023.




Delhi’s air quality remained alarmingly poor, with an annual average PM2.5 concentration of 91.6 micrograms per cubic metre, barely lower than the 92.7 micrograms per cubic metre recorded in 2023, the report said. The 13 Indian cities featured in the global top 20 most polluted list include Byrnihat, Delhi, Mullanpur (Punjab), Faridabad, Loni, New Delhi, Gurugram, Ganganagar, Greater Noida, Bhiwadi, Muzaffarnagar, Hanumangarh, and Noida.

But with so many people, coupled with pollution and poor waste management, the water could be highly contaminated. Fecal coliform bacteria, industrial effluents, and other contaminants in the water render it unsafe even for partial immersion, not to mention drinking.


Increasing pollution levels at Mahakumbh


Contamination of waters is a persistent issue, with rituals that include immersing idols, flowers, and other offerings add more to this concern. Research has repeatedly demonstrated that bacterial and chemical pollutants spike during the festival. A study conducted by the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) found that fecal coliform levels in the Ganges during 2019. Yet another report by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) showed that biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) levels, which are a measure of organic pollution, shot up during the festival, further establishing the dangerous condition of the river.


Health hazards of polluted water


Swimming in contaminated water can expose individuals to a range of health hazards, from mild infections to serious, life-threatening illnesses. Some of the most prevalent health risks are:


1. Diarrhea and Gastroenteritis – Bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella present in contaminated water can cause gastrointestinal infections, leading to diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration


2. Skin and Eye Infections – Excessive amounts of pollutants and bacteria present in the water can cause allergic reactions, rashes, and eye infections in individuals who bathe in it


3. Pneumonia and Respiratory Problems – When contaminated water finds its way into the respiratory system, it may cause lung infections such as pneumonia, primarily in those with compromised immune systems


4. Post-Infectious Autoimmune Diseases – Contact with some pathogens in contaminated water may cause autoimmune diseases like Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS), which results in paralysis due to damage to the nervous system


Vulnerable Populations


Although many people only experience mild symptoms, people with low immunity-diabetics, persons with hypertension, and pre-existing conditions have greater risk. For these people, exposure to contaminated water can lead to severe infections, prolonged illnesses, and, in some cases, even mortality.


Steps to Minimize Health Hazards


Considering the severity of water contamination on the Kumbh Mela, devotees ought to take precautions. These include:


Avoid full-body submersion: Deviating from bathing completely may prove less hazardous, whereas total immersion puts you at a higher risk of infection.
No drinking river water: Accidentally swallowing any river water can lead to gut infection with harmful bacteria and viruses.
Seek medical assistance as soon as possible: Seek your healthcare provider’s intervention in case of persistent diarrhea, fever, or respiratory troubles after having attended Kumbh Mela.

The rising pollutant-induced levels in the waters are a threat to health. Scientific studies and expert opinions suggest that exposure to contaminated river water may lead to a long list of sicknesses ranging from water-borne to allergic diseases and even autoimmune disorders. To contain this crisis and enable the public to go safe and healthy, both the devotees and authorities need, together, to work at a safer, cleaner pilgrimage experience for all.

This comes after a Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) report to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) suggested high presence of ‘fecal coliform’ bacteria in the river where crores have taken holy dip in the Maha Kumbh since it began on January 13.
According to UP government figures, over 58 crore people have taken a dip in the sacred waters of Triveni Sangam, the confluence of Ganga, Yamuna and Saraswati, at the ongoing Maha Kumbh in Prayagraj since the gathering started.
UP CM Yogi Adityanath has already dismissed the report, saying that the Sangam water was ‘fit for bathing.’
What did the UP government release say?
The UP government release was in reference to the CPCB data flagging doubts about the Ganga water quality at the Maha Kumbh.""Padma Shri Dr. Ajay Kumar Sonkar, a renowned scientist, has challenged skeptics and debunked doubts about Ganga's purity with scientific evidence,"" stated the government release quoted in a PTI report.
The UP government release stated that Dr. Sonkar collected water samples from five major bathing ghats, including Sangam Nose and Arail in Maha Kumbh Nagar.
""These samples were then subjected to microscopic examination in his laboratory. To his surprise, despite crores of devotees bathing in the river, there was no bacterial growth or decline in the water's pH level,"" the release stated.
According to the government release, Dr. Sonkar's research revealed that Ganga water contains 1,100 types of bacteriophages -- natural viruses that eliminate harmful bacteria.
""This self-purifying mechanism ensures that the river remains uncontaminated even after 57 crore devotees have taken a dip,"" the release stated.


The controversy over the quality of water started days after a CPCB report suggested that the biological oxygen demand (BOD) of river water at Sangam was 3.94 milligrams per litre on January 13, when the Maha Kumbh started.
It improved to 2.28 milligrams per litre on Makar Sankranti (January 14) and further dropped to 1 milligram per litre on January 15. However, it rose to 4.08 milligrams per litre on January 24 and was recorded at 3.26 milligrams per litre on Mauni Amavasya (January 29).
BOD refers to the amount of oxygen required by aerobic microorganisms to break down organic material in a water body. A higher BOD level indicates more organic content in the water. River water is considered fit for bathing if the BOD level is less than 3 milligrams per litre.
This BOD level at Sangam was 5.09 milligrams per litre at 5 am on January 16. It was recorded at 4.6 milligrams per litre at 5 pm on January 18 and 5.29 milligrams per litre at 8 am on January 19 (Wednesday).
In a report submitted to the National Green Tribunal on February 3, the CPCB said the river water quality did not meet bathing standards during monitoring on January 12-13 at most locations in Prayagraj.
However, the government release suggested otherwise.
""Dr Sonkar confirmed that the river's pH level, ranging between 8.4 and 8.6, is better than normal and that no foul smell or bacterial growth was detected,"" the government stated in the release.
""No harmful bacteria developed after incubating the water samples for 14 hours,"" according to the release.
""He (Dr. Sonkar) has openly challenged sceptics to accompany him to the ghats, collect water samples and verify their purity in the laboratory. Despite over 58 crore people bathing in the river during the Maha Kumbh, Ganga water remains naturally disease-free due to its inherent purifying properties,"" the release stated.
""Dr Sonkar highlighted a significant aspect of the Maha Kumbh -- how Ganga water was portrayed as highly polluted even before the event began. He questioned these claims, stating that if the river were indeed contaminated, there would have been a global outcry by now, with hospitals overwhelmed by patients,"" the release added.
Professor Venkatesh Dutta, who heads the Department of Environmental Science at Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University (BBAU), told PTI that Ganga water is not static but is constantly flowing.

With over 450 million pilgrims expected, concerns over Ganga water quality and waste management efforts remain despite digital and green initiatives

This is the Mahakumbh Mela. The Hindu pilgrimage, celebrated every six and twelve years (known as Ardh and Mahakumbh, respectively), is currently underway from January 13 to February 26, 2025. It is expected to host over 450 million pilgrims. This year, the event is being hailed as the first ‘Digital Mahakumbh’ due to its adoption of technology, as well as the first ‘Green Kumbh’, with sustainability and waste management at its core. But do these claims of effective waste management align with the reality on the ground?


A petition filed by former Indian Police Service Officer, Amitabh Thakur, in the National Green Tribunal has raised concerns about the quality of water in the river Ganga. The petition argued that the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) and the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) have failed to upload any information regarding this matter.


At the Mahakumbh this year, thousands of devotees will immerse themselves in the river daily, adding to the burden of river rejuvenation and conservation efforts.


Back on September 25, 2000, the Ministry of Environment and Forests issued a notification prescribing the maximum permissible limits for outdoor bathing.


In 2019, the Kumbh Mela attracted 130.2 million people (according to the CPCB report, Environmental Footprints of Mass Bathing on Water Quality of River Ganga during Kumbh Mela). The Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) at Kuresar Ghat, which measures the oxygen required to break down organic matter, ranged from 2.5 to 8.6 milligrams per litre—exceeding the permissible limit of 3 milligrams per litre. Meanwhile, at Sangam, the confluence of the Ganga and Yamuna, fecal coliform levels ranged from less than 1.8 to 23,000 MPN (Most Probable Number), far surpassing the maximum permissible limit of 2,500 MPN per 100 ml.


Just two months prior to this year's Mahakumbh, in November 2024, the fecal coliform bacteria count at downstream Sangam was measured at 3,300 MPN/ml—above the permissible limit of 2,500 MPN per 100 litres.


The petition filed by the former IPS officer also stated that no data had been uploaded on the performance of Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) and geo-tubes, nor had other analytical reports of samples taken from outlets been made available. According to the National Green Tribunal (NGT), devotees should have been informed about the quality of water they were bathing in, but it was found that this had not been done.


In its December 2024 order, the NGT called for adequate availability of Ganga water that should be safe for drinking and bathing. However, the report revealed that the smaller streams of the Ganga had not been cleaned.


On January 14, 2025, the CPCB’s real-time water quality monitoring system measured the BOD level at the Prayagraj Sangam at 4 mg per ml, exceeding the normal limit of 3 mg per ml. A higher BOD indicates a higher concentration of organic matter in the water.


For this 45-day religious gathering, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) have contributed to sewage treatment efforts. A Hybrid Granular Sequencing Batch Reactor (hgSBR) has been set up at the Mahakumbh to treat human waste and grey water. According to BARC, this compact biological treatment method is effective in removing contaminants. In line with the government’s ‘zero tolerance approach’ to open defecation, 145,000 toilets have also been established.


The Mahakumbh Mela is a colossal event that demands exceptional management of logistics and infrastructure. However, the situation is dire, with dead fish frequently spotted floating in the Ganga and Yamuna. This raises the question: What happened to the Rs 40,000 crore spent on the Namami Ganga programme over the past decade? The question remains—can the river ecosystem withstand the impact of 40 million people living and bathing in it? While efforts have been made to mitigate the damage, the Ganga will likely suffer another significant blow to its ecosystem once the Kumbh Mela concludes.",Indian,Down to Earth,"Mahakumbh Mela 2025: Is it safe to take a dip in the Ganga?

Tens of millions of people participate in the Kumbh Mela
The Kumbh Mela (also known as Mahakumbh) - is held once every 12 years.
Hindus believe that taking a dip at Sangam - the confluence of India's most sacred Ganges river with the Yamuna river and the mythical Saraswati - will cleanse them of sins, purify their soul and help them attain salvation.
The Mela, which stretches over six weeks, draws devotees from all walks of life and from all around the world. Tens of millions have been bathing in the rivers daily during the festival, which will end on 26 February.
However, health activists and environmentalists have expressed concern over the water quality of the rivers during the festival.
Before the Mela began, India's top environment court had directed the pollution control boards of the federal and state governments to monitor the water in the rivers regularly and to take adequate steps to maintain its quality.
But a report submitted by the federal government's Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) earlier this month stated that the waters of the Ganges and Yamuna had high coliform levels.
Coliform level is a key indicator of the presence of untreated sewage and faecal bacteria in water.

What is Kumbh Mela and why is this Hindu festival important?
The report said that the coliform levels in the Ganges were 1,400 times more than the acceptable limit, and in the Yamuna river, they were 660 times more.
The CPCB analysed water samples from both the rivers on five separate days in January, but the coliform levels never met standards, the report added.
Chief Minister Adityanath, however, insisted that his government was continuously monitoring water in the rivers to maintain its quality.
""All the pipes and the drains in and around Sangam have been taped and the water is being released only after purification,"" he said.
""The reasons for increased faecal coliform can be several, such as sewage leakage and animal waste, but the amount of faecal coliform in Prayagraj is as per the standards,"" he added.
He accused the opposition of running a ""false campaign"" to defame the Kumbh Mela.
This is not the first time that the Uttar Pradesh government has come under scrutiny for the way it has organised and is managing the Kumbh Mela.

Ganga’s smaller streams have not been fully cleaned, even though millions of people are gathered in a few kilometres’ radius around PrayagrajAre the waters of the Ganga river in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, during the ongoing Mahakumbh completely clean? According to media reports, by 3 PM on January 14, 25 million devotees had bathed at the Sangam. 


As per the National Green Tribunal’s (NGT) directives, these devotees should have been informed about the quality of the water they were about to dip into. However, Down To Earth (DTE) has learnt that it is not being done.


In its order of December 2024, the NGT stated that during the Mahakumbh, there should be adequate availability of Ganga water in Prayagraj, and its quality should be suitable for drinking, sipping, and bathing.


Given the vast crowds attending the festival during Makar Sankranti, the Ganga’s smaller streams have not been fully cleaned, even though millions of people are gathered in a few kilometres’ radius around Prayagraj.


According to the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) real-time water quality monitoring system, the Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) level at the Prayagraj Sangam was measured at four mg per ml, exceeding the normal limit of 3 mg per ml by 2 pm on January 14, 2025.


A higher BOD indicates a higher concentration of organic matter in the water, signifying poor water quality.


As per the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB), the BOD for organised bathing should not exceed 3 mg per litre at 20°C over a five-day period.


Despite continuous water discharge to improve the flow in the river, this outcome is concerning. It suggests that sewage management through drains or sewage treatment plants (STPs) is not being carried out effectively.


Previous order from the NGT mandates that devotees should be informed of the quality of the Ganga’s water in real-time through online displays, 24 hours a day. However, the platform called Sustainability of River Ganga Water designed for this purpose is not functioning.


Moreover, the UPPCB’s website only provides water quality data until November 2024.


This is not the first time such issues have been raised. In 2019, the CPCB’s report on the Kumbh in Prayagraj clearly indicated that the water quality was poor, even on major bathing days.


The CPCB’s report, ‘Environmental Footprints of Mass Bathing on Water Quality of River Ganga during Kumbh Mela’ highlighted this issue.


During the 2019 Kumbh Mela, 130.2 million people participated. According to the report, BOD and fecal coliform levels at Karsar Ghat were found to be above acceptable limits. On major bathing days, BOD levels were significantly higher in the morning compared to the evening. Additionally, on Mahashivaratri and subsequent days, fecal coliform levels exceeded the standards both in the morning and evening.


The dissolved oxygen levels in the Yamuna River met the standards throughout, but pH, BOD, and fecal coliform were not consistently within acceptable limits on various occasions. Among the tributaries of the Ganga, the Kali River was found to be the most polluted.


Alarmingly, even at the Sangam, where people specifically bathe, the water remained polluted during the Kumbh.


Major takeaways
According to the report, the monitoring of Ganga river water quality at the Sangam was carried out twice daily, in the morning and evening. The report noted two major points:


Firstly, in the morning, the water quality of the Ganga met external bathing water quality standards for dissolved oxygen (DO) on all occasions, but pH (6 occasions), BOD (16 occasions), and fecal coliform (6 occasions) did not meet the standards.


Secondly, in the evening, DO met the bathing standards on all occasions, but pH (six occasions), BOD (15 occasions), and fecal coliform (six occasions) did not meet the required standards. Additionally, on most auspicious bathing days, BOD levels at the Sangam were considerably higher in the evening compared to the morning.


Moreover, on Mahashivaratri and subsequent days, fecal coliform levels were found to exceed the bathing standards both in the morning and evening.


The conductivity of river water is typically between 100 and 1,000 microsiemens per centimetre. At present, the conductivity at the Sangam is 704 microsiemens per centimetre, which is considered good. However, as the discharge decreases, this could further deteriorate the water quality.",Indian,Down to Earth,"Mahakumbh 2025: Unaware of water quality at Prayagraj, 25 million devotees took holy dip in Ganga Ganga’s smaller streams have not been fully cleaned, even though millions of people are gathered in a few kilometres’ radius around PrayagrajAre the waters of the Ganga river in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, during the ongoing Mahakumbh completely clean?

According to the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) real-time water quality monitoring system, the Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) level at the Prayagraj Sangam was measured at four mg per ml, exceeding the normal limit of 3 mg per ml by 2 pm on January 14, 2025. A higher BOD indicates a higher concentration of organic matter in the water, signifying poor water quality. As per the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB), the BOD for organised bathing should not exceed 3 mg per litre at 20°C over a five-day period. Despite continuous water discharge to improve the flow in the river, this outcome is concerning. It suggests that sewage management through drains or sewage treatment plants (STPs) is not being carried out effectively. Previous order from the NGT mandates that devotees should be informed of the quality of the Ganga’s water in real-time through online displays, 24 hours a day. However, the platform called Sustainability of River Ganga Water designed for this purpose is not functioning. Moreover, the UPPCB’s website only provides water quality data until November 2024. This is not the first time such issues have been raised. In 2019, the CPCB’s report on the Kumbh in Prayagraj clearly indicated that the water quality was poor, even on major bathing days. The CPCB’s report, ‘Environmental Footprints of Mass Bathing on Water Quality of River Ganga during Kumbh Mela’ highlighted this issue. During the 2019 Kumbh Mela, 130.2 million people participated. According to the report, BOD and fecal coliform levels at Karsar Ghat were found to be above acceptable limits. On major bathing days, BOD levels were significantly higher in the morning compared to the evening. Additionally, on Mahashivaratri and subsequent days, fecal coliform levels exceeded the standards both in the morning and evening. The dissolved oxygen levels in the Yamuna River met the standards throughout, but pH, BOD, and fecal coliform were not consistently within acceptable limits on various occasions. Among the tributaries of the Ganga, the Kali River was found to be the most polluted. Alarmingly, even at the Sangam, where people specifically bathe, the water remained polluted during the Kumbh. Major takeaways According to the report, the monitoring of Ganga river water quality at the Sangam was carried out twice daily, in the morning and evening. The report noted two major points: Firstly, in the morning, the water quality of the Ganga met external bathing water quality standards for dissolved oxygen (DO) on all occasions, but pH (6 occasions), BOD (16 occasions), and fecal coliform (6 occasions) did not meet the standards. Secondly, in the evening, DO met the bathing standards on all occasions, but pH (six occasions), BOD (15 occasions), and fecal coliform (six occasions) did not meet the required standards. Additionally, on most auspicious bathing days, BOD levels at the Sangam were considerably higher in the evening compared to the morning. Moreover, on Mahashivaratri and subsequent days, fecal coliform levels were found to exceed the bathing standards both in the morning and evening. The conductivity of river water is typically between 100 and 1,000 microsiemens per centimetre. At present, the conductivity at the Sangam is 704 microsiemens per centimetre, which is considered good. However, as the discharge decreases, this could further deteriorate the water quality.",Belief Aligned,0.3564065099,0.5502727032,0.09332078695,Critical of Government,0.3856143653,0.4180720448,0.1963136047

High levels of faecal coliform found amid millions bathing during the festival raise health concerns.
New Delhi: The sacred waters of the Ganga and Yamuna are under scrutiny as health officials raise alarms over significant contamination during the Maha Kumbh Mela 2025, held at Prayagraj. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has reported alarming levels of faecal coliform bacteria, which exceeds acceptable limits for bathing water, posing serious public health concerns for millions of participating devotees.


According to the CPCB's report submitted to the National Green Tribunal (NGT), the levels of faecal coliform—a key indicator of microbial contamination—were found to be staggeringly high. On January 13, 2025, faecal coliform concentrations reached around 23,000 MPN/100ml at Shringverpur Ghat and soared to 700,000 MPN/100ml at the sacred Sangam area just days later, on January 20. Notably, the permissible limit for this bacteria type for bathing water is 2,500 units per 100 ml.




This contamination problem is worsened by several factors, including untreated sewage discharge, open defecation, and the massive influx of pilgrims who come to perform ritualistic baths, especially on auspicious days. With millions expected to bathe during the festival, the danger of spreading waterborne diseases increases. ""The river water quality was not conforming with the primary water quality for bathing with reference to faecal coliform [FC] at all the monitored locations on various occasions,"" stated the NGT, reflecting the serious nature of the situation.


The Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) was criticized by the NGT for its inadequate reporting and lack of comprehensive plans to tackle the pollution issue. A hearing on February 19 highlights the urgency placed upon state authorities to address these health hazards effectively. ""Even upon reviewing the documents... high levels of faecal and total coliform have been found at various locations,"" noted the NGT order.


Environmental and public health experts are deeply concerned. They have pointed out the potential for severe health risks, including gastrointestinal infections, skin and eye disorders, typhoid, and hepatitis, especially among the vulnerable segments of the population, such as children and the elderly. The presence of faecal coliform indicates possible sewage contamination, which raises alarms over the risk of disease-causing pathogens.


Despite these grave concerns, Union Minister for Science and Technology Jitendra Singh claimed during his visit to Prayagraj on January 30, 2025, ""Not even a single case of skin disease or other illness has been reported from the Kumbh Mela."" He attributed the cleanliness of the river to technology contributed by India's nuclear research facilities, claiming it helps maintain hygiene standards at the event.


Nevertheless, experts are urging the government to take immediate steps to curb pollution. ""There are 10 sewage treatment plants (STPs) established around Prayagraj, but the Ponghat STP reportedly failed to meet environmental norms, leading to concerns about its effect on water quality,"" they pointed out. There is also considerable public pressure for increasing sewage treatment efficiency and preventing untreated waste from entering the river.


During the Kumbh Mela, authorities have urged the akharas (spiritual groups) to adhere to scheduled timings to allow for cleaning operations, and they have been distributing cloth bags and stainless steel utensils to minimize plastic waste disposal issues. This initiative, along with increased monitoring of water quality by the CPCB and UPPCB, is seen as necessary to protect the health of the millions who honor the Ganga's sacredness by bathing amid festivities.


The Maha Kumbh Mela, among the largest religious gatherings globally, not only has deep cultural and religious ties but also presents significant environmental and public health challenges. Observations call for immediate regulatory action from the NGT and continued efforts to restore and maintain the Ganga and Yamuna's water quality as the festival progresses.


While the NGT has called for accountability, the outcome of their directives to tackle the increasing pollution remains to be seen. Institutions responsible for monitoring water quality must act decisively to safeguard the interests of millions who rely on these sacred rivers.

-Analysis-


NEW DELHI — As millions of Indians flock to the Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj, one needs to look at how the Ganga and Yamuna rivers are doing.


Can the river ecosystem take the shock of about 40 million people living and bathing in it?


It was only recently that the Yamuna in Delhi was frothing with toxic foam. The river is understood to be carrying industrial and city waste. And despite various National Green Tribunal orders against the discharge of untreated sewage water in the river, practically nothing has been done. I visited Allahabad recently and found that the stretch from the Bullua ghat to Rasoolabad ghat had many sewage creeks entering the river, which bore untreated waste. Most of these sewage lines are right next to designated bathing areas.


If we look at the Aarel ghat on the other bank of the river, it tells the same tale. Countless sewage drains also enter the river right before the Triveni Sangam of the Ganga and the Yamuna. Most of this is for all to see, yet so many purported efforts made to stop the sewage from entering the rivers have apparently been fruitless.




A fragile ecosystem


The situation is so dire that the sight of dead fish floating in the Ganga and Yamuna is common now. One wonders what happened to the Rs 40,000 crore spent on the Namami Ganga program in the past decade with Narendra Modi as prime minister. The public relations exercise has failed to clean the river. Far from cleaning the Ganga, the Modi government appears hell bent on further damaging it by allowing hydel projects on her tributaries, thus destroying her ecosystem.


Releasing of more water from dams at Tehri and other hydel projects is only a temporary solution, the health of the river is beyond fragile due to contamination and pollution in Allahabad. The city is ill-equipped to tackle its own sewage waste, so we wonder what will happen once 40 million come to it.


The river Ganga is a lifeline for a majority of Indians.
The answer is pretty straight forward, the Ganga will suffer another major blow to its ecosystem once the Kumbh Mela is over. The water of the Ganga is highly polluted and with no plans to reduce sewage and pollutants from entering the river, it will become more toxic. This will end up endangering plants, riverine communities and fishes. The city of Allahabad would have to suffer for months to come from the pollution and a diseased river system.


So what is all this being done for? Definitely not the river Ganga, because if Modi was serious about cleaning the river, then the last 10 years and Rs 40,000 crores is all he needed. If Modi adopted the double-engine approach towards the Namami Ganga programme, maybe there is a good chance the Ganga would be much cleaner and the cities of Allahabad and Kanpur would not be dumping millions of gallons of untreated sewage in the rivers everyday.

Modi's exploitation


Most religious sects are also deeply concerned about the river system and also have been given an unfriendly treatment by the Modi government when it comes to inclusion in the planning process. This is also the first ever “corporate” Kumbh – it is being organised with the help of a firm, Ernst and Young.


Many Hindus treat the river Ganga as their mother. Even outside of religion beliefs, it’s a lifeline for a majority of Indians. All would have been deeply happy if the thousands of crores spent on public relations and posters was actually spent on cleaning the river and blocking the sewage drains. That was the real work that needed to be done. It is clear now that the Kumbh Mela 2025 is a religious event that Modi is exploiting for political mileage. The organisers care little for Hindu faith, spirituality or the health of the river Ganga.


Can the Ganga survive another Kumbh? It will, but her ecosystem will be destroyed for humans, plants and marine life alike. This could become a hot bed for infections and further pollute the river.

Water Quality During Maha Kumbh Fit For Bathing, Pollution Control Board Report Finds
New Delhi:
A new report by the Central Pollution Control Board submitted to the National Green Tribunal has said that as per statistical analysis, the water quality during the recently-concluded Maha Kumbh in Prayagraj was fit for bathing.


The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) report said the statistical analysis was necessitated because of ""variability of data"" in the samples collected from the same locations across different dates and on different locations on the same day, because of which these did not reflect the ""overall river water quality throughout the river stretch"".


The report dated February 28 and uploaded on the tribunal's website on March 7 said the board had conducted water monitoring twice a week from January 12 onwards, including on auspicious bathing days, at five locations on Ganga river and two locations on Yamuna river.


""There is a significant variability in the values on various parameters, viz pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and fecal coliform count (FC) for the samples taken from the same location on different dates. The values of the afore-mentioned parameters also vary at different locations for the samples collected on the same day,"" the report said.


The DO or the amount of oxygen in water, BOD, which measures the amount of oxygen needed to break down organic matter in water, and FC, a marker of sewage contamination, are key indicators of water quality.










The report said that an expert committee examined the issue of ""variability in data"" and said that ""the data represents a snapshot of water quality at a specific location and time and may vary significantly depending upon factors such as upstream anthropogenic activities (human actions), rate of flow, depth of sampling, time of sampling, river current and mixing of currents, sampling location and such other multiple factors"".


""As a result, these values reflect water quality parameters at the exact time and place from where these water samples were collected, and may not fully represent the overall characteristics of the river, therefore, not necessarily reflecting the overall river water quality throughout the river stretch,"" it said.


The report also said that because of the variability, a statistical analysis of water quality data of various monitoring locations for the key parameters was undertaken from January 12 to February 22 at 10 locations of ""mass bathing"" and that 20 rounds of monitoring were done.


""It is submitted that as per the above-mentioned statistical analysis, the median value (central tendency of the data) of pH, DO, BOD and FC for the monitored stretches is within the respective criteria/permissible limits,"" the report noted.


According to the report, the median value for FC was 1,400 as compared to the permissible limit of 2,500 units per 100 ml, while the DO was 8.7 vis-a-vis the stipulated norm of being greater than 5 milligram per litre, and the BOD was 2.56 against the stipulated limit of less than or equal to 3 mg per litre.


On February 17, the CPCB had informed the tribunal through a report that various locations in Prayagraj during the Maha Kumbh were not conforming to the primary water quality for bathing with respect to the level of faecal coliform.


""The river water quality was not conforming to the primary water quality for bathing with respect to faecal coliform at all the monitored locations on various occasions.


""A large number of people bathe in the river at Prayagraj during the Maha Kumbh Mela, including on auspicious bathing days, which eventually leads to an increase in faecal concentration,"" the report had said.

Ganga Water Was Fit For Bathing During Maha Kumbh, Parliament Told
Triveni Sangam is where the Ganga meets the Yamuna and Saraswati rivers. New Delhi:
The central government on Monday cited a new report from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in Parliament and said the water in the Ganga at Triveni Sangam in Prayagraj was fit for bathing during the recently concluded Maha Kumbh.


Triveni Sangam is where the Ganga meets the Yamuna and Saraswati rivers.


The government also said it had provided a total of Rs 7,421 crore to the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) for cleaning the river in 2022-23, 2023-24 and 2024-25 (until March 9).


In response to a question from Samajwadi Party MP Anand Bhadauria and Congress MP K Sudhakaran, Union Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav said that according to the CPCB report, the median values of pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and faecal coliform (FC) at all monitored locations were within the permissible limits for bathing.


DO refers to the amount of oxygen in water, BOD measures the oxygen needed to break down organic matter and FC is an indicator of sewage contamination. These are key indicators of water quality.




In a report dated February 3, the CPCB had informed the National Green Tribunal (NGT) that water at several locations in Prayagraj during the Maha Kumbh did not meet the primary bathing water quality standard due to high faecal coliform levels.


However, in a new report submitted to the tribunal on February 28, the CPCB said statistical analysis showed that the water quality during the Maha Kumbh was fit for bathing.


The report said that the statistical analysis was necessary due to the ""variability of data"" in samples collected from the same locations on different dates and even from different spots on the same day. This variability meant the samples did not fully reflect the ""overall river water quality throughout the river stretch"", it said.


In the case of ""Kamlesh Singh vs State of Uttar Pradesh & Others"", the NGT had on December 23, 2024 directed that water quality monitoring of the Ganga and Yamuna should be conducted regularly at frequent intervals during the Maha Kumbh to ensure compliance with primary water quality criteria.


Yadav said that in response to this order, the CPCB carried out water quality monitoring at seven locations twice a week, from Shringverpur Ghat (upstream of Prayagraj) to Deehaghat (downstream), including at Sangam nose (where the Ganga and the Yamuna meet). Monitoring began on January 12 and covered auspicious bathing (Amrit Snan) days.


The CPCB submitted its initial monitoring report to the NGT on February 3, which included water quality data collected between January 12 and 26, 2025. The report also included monitoring data from 10 sewage treatment plants (STPs) installed in Prayagraj and seven geosynthetic dewatering tubes (geo-tubes) used for filtration, Yadav said.


Later, the CPCB increased the number of monitoring locations to 10 and began testing twice daily from February 21 to improve water quality data availability.


The minister said the Uttar Pradesh government installed 10 STPs for the Maha Kumbh to treat wastewater, ensuring that effluents met environmental standards before being released. Also, seven geo-tubes were installed as a temporary solution to treat wastewater from 21 untapped drains.


Three prefabricated temporary STPs, each with a capacity of 500 kilolitres per day (KLD) and three faecal sludge treatment plants with a total capacity of 200 KLD were installed in the mela area.

New Delhi: The central government on Monday cited a new report from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in Parliament and said the water in the Ganga at Triveni Sangam in Prayagraj was fit for bathing during the recently concluded Maha Kumbh. Triveni Sangam is where the Ganga meets the Yamuna and Saraswati rivers. The government also said it had provided a total of Rs 7,421 crore to the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) for cleaning the river in 2022-23, 2023-24 and 2024-25 (until March 9). In response to a question from Samajwadi Party MP Anand Bhadauria and Congress MP K Sudhakaran, Union Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav said that according to the CPCB report, the median values of pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and faecal coliform (FC) at all monitored locations were within the permissible limits for bathing. DO refers to the amount of oxygen in water, BOD measures the oxygen needed to break down organic matter and FC is an indicator of sewage contamination. These are key indicators of water quality.

https://thewire.in/environment/can-the-ganga-survive-the-kumbh-mela,Can the Ganga Survive the Kumbh Mela?,"As millions of Indians flock to the Kumbh Mela in Allahabad (now Prayagraj), one needs to look at how the Ganga and Yamuna rivers are doing.


Can the river ecosystem take the shock of about 40 million people living and bathing in it? 


It was only recently that the Yamuna in Delhi was frothing with toxic foam. The river is understood to be carrying industrial and city waste. And despite various National Green Tribunal orders against the discharge of untreated sewage water in the river, practically nothing has been done. I visited Allahabad recently and found that the stretch from the Bullua ghat to Rasoolabad ghat had many sewage creeks entering the river, which bore untreated waste. Most of these sewage lines are right next to designated bathing areas. If we look at the Aarel ghat on the other bank of the river, it tells the same tale. Countless sewage drains also enter the river right before the Triveni Sangam of the Ganga and the Yamuna. Most of this is for all to see, yet so many purported efforts made to stop the sewage from entering the rivers have apparently been fruitless.


The situation is so dire that the sight of dead fish floating in the Ganga and Yamuna is common now. One wonders what happened to the Rs 40,000 crore spent on the Namami Ganga programme in the past decade with Narendra Modi as prime minister. The public relations exercise has failed to clean the river. Far from cleaning the Ganga, the Modi government appears hell bent on further damaging it by allowing hydel projects on her tributaries, thus destroying her ecosystem. 


Releasing of more water from dams at Tehri and other hydel projects is only a temporary solution, the health of the river is beyond fragile due to contamination and pollution in Allahabad. The city is ill-equipped to tackle its own sewage waste, so we wonder what will happen once 40 million come to it.

The answer is pretty straight forward, the Ganga will suffer another major blow to its ecosystem once the Kumbh Mela is over. The water of the Ganga is highly polluted and with no plans to reduce sewage and pollutants from entering the river, it will become more toxic. This will end up endangering plants, riverine communities and fishes. The city of Allahabad would have to suffer for months to come from the pollution and a diseased river system. 




So what is all this being done for? Definitely not the river Ganga, because if Modi was serious about cleaning the river, then the last 10 years and Rs 40,000 crores is all he needed. If Modi adopted the double-engine approach towards the Namami Ganga programme, maybe there is a good chance the Ganga would be much cleaner and the cities of Allahabad and Kanpur would not be dumping millions of gallons of untreated sewage in the rivers everyday. 


Most religious sects are also deeply concerned about the river system and also have been given an unfriendly treatment by the Modi government when it comes to inclusion in the planning process. This is also the first ever “corporate” Kumbh – it is being organised with the help of a firm, Ernst and Young.


Many Hindus treat the river Ganga as their mother. Even outside of religion beliefs, it’s a lifeline for a majority of Indians. All would have been deeply happy if the thousands of crores spent on public relations and posters was actually spent on cleaning the river and blocking the sewage drains. That was the real work that needed to be done. It is clear now that the Kumbh Mela 2025 is a religious event that Modi is exploiting for political mileage. The organisers care little for Hindu faith, spirituality or the health of the river Ganga.


Can the Ganga survive another Kumbh? It will, but her ecosystem will be destroyed for humans, plants and marine life alike. This could become a hot bed for infections and further pollute the river.


The river will survive, but I do not think it will be able to heal or nourish anyone for very long afterwards.

Earlier, the Central Pollution Control Board had – citing water quality tests – said  that the water in the Ganga at several locations including Prayagraj was not fit for bathing. This report, also submitted to the NGT, had said that fecal coliform levels were very high. And it came at a crucial time – on February 3, right in the middle of the Kumbh festival that lasted from January 13 to February 26 this year.


Among the rituals practiced by believers at the Kumbh are bathing in the water, and even consuming a few mouthfuls of it. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Adityanath had denied the CPCB’s February 3 findings, claiming that the water in the Ganga was fit to bathe in and take ritual sips of. 


CPCB backtracks


In its latest report, which The Wire accessed, dated February 28 and submitted to the NGT, the CPCB has said that the water at several locations in the Ganga and Yamuna was within permissible limits for bathing from January 12 to February 22.


The CPCB has cited median values for water pH, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand and fecal coliform (all crucial parameters to test water quality). All these values fall within permissible limits. According to the CPCB, this was based on monitoring of water quality at seven locations – five in the Ganga and two in the Yamuna – twice a week from January 12 to February 22, as well as three more locations in the Ganga in Prayagraj on February 21 and February 22. Specifically, the median value of fecal coliform quoted in the report is 1,700 MPN (most probable number) per 100 ml at Sangam, 1,700 at all mass-bathing locations that were monitored across these days, and 1,400 for all 10 monitored locations (of which data for three locations was only collected for two days). Permissible levels of fecal coliform in river water should be less than 2,500 MPN per 100 ml. 


“It is submitted that as per the above-mentioned statistical analysis, median value of pH, DO, BOD and FC for the monitored stretches is within the respective criteria/ permissible limits for bathing water,” the report said. 




Essentially, the CPCB has now backtracked on its findings. 


The levels of fecal coliform listed by the CPCB in its report to the NGT on February 3 were nearly twenty times higher in magnitude than they should have been. At Sangam ghat in Prayagraj, for example, total and fecal coliform levels increased from 4,500 and 2,000 MPN/100 ml on January 12 to 49,000 and 11,000 MPN/100 ml on January 14. This again rose to a total coliform level of 7,00,000 MPN/ 100 ml and fecal coliform level of 49,000 MPN/100 ml on January 19. These were not median values. 


In that report, the CPCB had said that “River water quality was not conforming with the primary water quality for bathing w.r.t. Fecal Coliform (FC) at all the monitored locations on various occasions”. It put down the increase in fecal coliform levels to the “huge number” of people bathing at Prayagraj during the Kumbh. However, as per the CPCB’s latest report to the NGT dated February 28, the reason for the differences in water quality parameters is “variability in the data”.


“It is humbly submitted that there is a significant variability in the values on various parameters, viz. pH, Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), and Fecal Coliform Count (FC) for the samples taken from the same location on different dates. The values of the afore-mentioned parameters also vary at different locations for the samples collected on the same day,” it read.


As per the report, an “expert committee” at CPCB had “examined the issue of variability in data” and that they held the view that the data represents only “a snapshot of water quality at a specific location and time” and “may not fully represent the overall characteristics of the river”. 


Yadav’s reply in Parliament


Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav quoted some of these details from this “comprehensive” report by the CPCB in his reply to questions posed by Anand Bhadauria (Member of Parliament from the Samajwadi Party) and K. Sudhakaran, a Congress MP from Kerala, regarding the quality of water in the Ganga and Yamuna at Prayagraj during the Kumbh. 


However, though their questions also included whether “the CPCB has recently published any report stating that faecal coliform levels at all monitored locations were above the permissible limit of 2,500 units per 100 ml, indicating significant sewage contamination, if so, the details thereof and if not, the reasons therefor”.


Yadav’s reply had no mention of the CPCB’s February 3 report that provided details of high levels of fecal coliform. His response only quoted the CPCB report dated February 28, which provides median values for all water quality parameters across a varying date range for varying locations, and shows that all were within permissible limits.


In his reply, Yadav also informed the Parliament that the government of India had released a total of Rs. 7,421.60 crore from financial year 2022-23 to March 3, 2025, to the National Mission for Clean Ganga, under which the Namami Gange programme has been taken up for the “rejuvenation” of the river since June 2014, after the BJP came into power.

The new CPCB report submitted to the NGT said the statistical analysis was necessitated because of ""variability of data"" in the samples collected from the same locations across different dates and on different locations on the same day, because of which these did not reflect the ""overall river water quality throughout the river stretch"", India Today reported.
The report, dated 28 February and uploaded on the tribunal's website on 7 March, said the board had conducted water monitoring bi-weekly from 12 January onwards, including on auspicious bathing days, at five locations on Ganga river and two locations on Yamuna river.
""There is a significant variability in the values on various parameters, viz pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and fecal coliform count (FC) for the samples taken from the same location on different dates. The values of the afore-mentioned parameters also vary at different locations for the samples collected on the same day,"" the report said.
DO, which indicates amount of oxygen in water, BOD, which measures the oxygen required to decompose organic matter in water, and FC, a marker of sewage contamination, are key indicators of water quality.
According to the report, an expert committee in CPCB examined the issue of ""variability in data"" and was of the view that ""the data represents a snapshot of water quality at a specific location and time and may vary significantly depending upon factors such as upstream anthropogenic activities (human actions), rate of flow, depth of sampling, time of sampling, river current and mixing of currents, sampling location and such other multiple factors"".
""As a result, these values reflect water quality parameters at the exact time and place from where these water samples were collected, and may not fully represent the overall characteristics of the river, therefore, not necessarily reflecting the overall river water quality throughout the river stretch,"" the report said.
The report also said that in view of the variability, a statistical analysis of water quality data of various monitoring locations for the key parameters was undertaken from 12 January to 22 February at 10 locations of ""mass bathing"" and that 20 rounds of monitoring were done.
""It is submitted that as per the above-mentioned statistical analysis, the median value (central tendency of the data) of pH, DO, BOD and FC for the monitored stretches is within the respective criteria/permissible limits for bathing water,"" the report noted.
As per the report, the median FC value stood at 1,400, well below the permissible limit of 2,500 units per 100 ml. The DO level was recorded at 8.7 mg/l, surpassing the required norm of 5 mg/l, while the BOD measured 2.56 mg/l, staying within the prescribed limit of ≤3 mg/l.

The release, quoting a scientist, asserted that the river water remains as pure ""as alkaline water"", countering Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data that had raised doubts about its quality, reported The Hindu.
According to figures provided by the state government, over 58 crore people have taken a dip in the sacred waters of Triveni Sangam—the confluence of Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati—since the start of the Maha Kumbh on 13 January.
The government's statement stated that Padma Shri awardee scientist Dr Ajay Kumar Sonkar collected water samples from five major bathing ghats, including Sangam Nose and Arail in Maha Kumbh Nagar.
The samples were then subjected to microscopic examination in his laboratory, which, according to the release, showed no bacterial growth or decline in the water's pH level, despite the massive number of devotees bathing in the river.
The release further stated that Dr Sonkar’s research identified 1,100 types of bacteriophages—natural viruses that eliminate harmful bacteria—contributing to what was described as the river's self-purifying mechanism.
""This self-purifying mechanism ensures that the river remains uncontaminated even after 57 crore devotees have taken a dip,"" the release stated, reported The Hindu.
The controversy over the quality of water started days after a CPCB report suggested that the biological oxygen demand (BOD) of river water at Sangam was 3.94 milligrams per litre on 13 January, when the Maha Kumbh started.
The CPCB’s water quality monitoring, however, suggested fluctuations in the river’s biological oxygen demand (BOD) levels.
The report recorded a BOD of 3.94 mg per litre on 13 January, which initially improved to 2.28 mg per litre on Makar Sankranti (14 January) and further dropped to 1 mg per litre on 15 January.
However, it later rose to 4.08 mg per litre on 24 January and stood at 3.26 mg per litre on Mauni Amavasya (29 January).
BOD is a key indicator of water quality, representing the oxygen required by microorganisms to break down organic matter.
A BOD level of under 3 mg per litre is considered fit for bathing, but on certain dates, the Sangam waters reportedly exceeded this threshold, with 5.09 mg per litre recorded on 16 January and 5.29 mg per litre on 19 January.
Despite the CPCB findings, the UP government release dismissed concerns, stating that Dr Sonkar confirmed that the river’s pH level remained between 8.4 and 8.6, which was ""better than normal"", with no foul smell or harmful bacterial growth detected even after 14 hours of incubation.
Furthermore, the release stated that Dr Sonkar has challenged sceptics to conduct their own sample testing, stating that if Ganga water were indeed polluted, it would have led to a global outcry and overwhelming cases of illness among pilgrims.
However, Professor Venkatesh Dutta, head of the Department of Environmental Science at Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University (BBAU), took a more measured stance, noting that Ganga is a flowing river and the timing and method of sampling significantly impact water quality assessments.
""I wouldn't be able to hazard a guess any which way on the quality of the Ganga water as of now. All that I can say is type; time of sampling also matters a lot,"" he told news agency PTI.",Indian,Swarajyamag,"The Uttar Pradesh government has issued a statement addressing concerns over the purity of the Ganga river at the ongoing Maha Kumbh in Prayagraj.

Govt Data Says,"NEW DELHI: The Ganga water at Triveni Sangam, where lakhs of people are taking a holy dip every day during the ongoing Maha Kumbh, is currently unsafe for bathing as it exceeds the prescribed limit for biological oxygen demand (BOD), a key parameter to determine water quality, according to government data. BOD refers to the amount of oxygen required by aerobic microorganisms to break down organic material in a water body. A higher BOD level indicates more organic content in the water. River water is considered fit for bathing if the BOD level is less than 3 milligrams per litre.




Government data shows that the river water at Sangam is currently exceeding this limit. The BOD level at Sangam was 5.09 milligrams per litre at 5 am on January 16. It was recorded at 4.6 milligrams per litre at 5 pm on January 18 and 5.29 milligrams per litre at 8 am on January 19 (Wednesday). According to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data, the BOD level at Sangam was 3.94 milligrams per litre on January 13 when the Maha Kumbh started.






It improved to 2.28 milligrams per litre on Makar Sankranti (January 14) and further dropped to 1 milligram per litre on January 15. However, it rose to 4.08 milligrams per litre on January 24 and was recorded at 3.26 milligrams per litre on Mauni Amavasya (January 29). In a report submitted to the National Green Tribunal on February 3, the CPCB said the river water quality did not meet bathing standards during monitoring on January 12-13 at most locations in Prayagraj.






""However, after that, organic pollution (in terms of BOD) started to decrease due to freshwater intrusion at upstream locations. After January 13, 2025, river water quality (is) conforming (to) the bathing criteria w.R.T. BOD except (at) Lord Curzon bridge on river Ganga on January 19, 2025,"" the CPCB report read.


According to Uttar Pradesh government officials, 10,000 to 11,000 cusecs of water is being released into the Ganga to ensure it meets bathing standards. The Maha Kumbh, which started on January 13, will conclude on February 26, Maha Shivaratri day. Over 54 crore people have taken a dip in the sacred waters of Triveni Sangam so far.


Mahakumbh Nagar is the world's largest temporary city, accommodating 50 lakh to 1 crore devotees at any given time. These pilgrims generate at least 16 million litres of faecal waste and 240 million litres of greywater daily from activities like cooking, washing, and bathing. Uttar Pradesh Chief Secretary Manoj Kumar Singh told reporters on Sunday that the rise in footfall is due to the government's success in improving river water quality and sanitation since the 2019 Ardh Kumbh.


""Before 2019, there would be no toilets at Kumbh. Officials would earmark an area with a red flag, provide tents, and open defecation used to take place. ""For the first time in 2019, we built 1.14 lakh individual toilets with Sintex (plastic) tanks underneath to collect wastewater and excreta. Desludging would be done every two-three days and the faecal sludge would be taken to open oxidation ponds far away. This time, we have constructed 1.5 lakh individual toilets and two faecal sludge treatment plants,"" he said.


A 200 km-long temporary drainage network has been set up to connect treatment facilities, Singh added. ""Sanitation is a big hallmark (of Kumbh arrangements), and those who have been to Kumbh previously can distinctly see the difference,"" he said.

In its report, the CPCB said that after analysing the water quality on a number of factors, their data suggests a noticeable improvement in several key water quality parameters which reflects the success of pollution control measures and enhanced treatment facilities.The water quality monitoring was conducted by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) under the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC). The monitoring covered Ganga and Yamuna rivers at multiple locations in Prayagraj during the Mahakumbh 2025. The study focused on key water quality parameters to asses pollution levels and safety for pilgrims.Higher dissolved oxygen ranging between 8.5 – 10.2 mg/L, significantly above the minimum required level (5 mg/L), was observed in the report ensuring better aquatic life support and improved water quality for rituals.
Marked Reduction in biochemical oxygen demand
The biochemical oxygen consistently remained within the safe bathing standards (2.5 – 3.2 mg/L), indicating reduced organic pollution and improved wastewater treatment.n most monitored locations, fecal coliform levels ranged from 1200 – 2500 MPN/100 ml, meeting permissible limits and reflecting better sewage treatment and hygiene management.
Chemical oxygen demand under control
The Chemical oxygen demand was maintained at 10 – 15 mg/L, indicating effective reduction of industrial and chemical pollutants entering the river.
Improved water clarity
Turbidity levels stabilised with water visibility at above 40- 60 cm in some locations showed better sediment management and controlled wastewater discharge. However at various other locations water remained cloudy and murky as indicated by higher turbidity (NTU) of around 120-190 cm.
Monitoring of water quality
The minute-to-minute, round-the-clock monitoring of water quality at the Mahakumbh, ensured that pollution levels are neither unchecked nor ignored. This real-time surveillance across multiple locations by the management ensured that no part of the river goes unmonitored, directly countering concerns that pollution is spiralling out of control or being neglected.Some notable incident and concerns
The CPCB in its report highlighted that the fecal coliform levels were maintained within the permissible limits. On some occasions, there were significant fluctuations in the water quality including on January 13, January 20 and January 24. However, authorities with their strong response system and effective use of technology, identified these fluctuations and took immediate measures to ensure that the FL remained within the safe limit.
The pollution control body listed out increased pilgrim activity, discharge of untreated wastewater, natural variations due to rainfall and sediment transport as factors for these fluctuations.
In entirety, during the course of the ongoing Mahakumbh, the dissolved oxygen witnessed a positive surge, Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) remained below 3 mg/l for safe bathing standards, Fecal Coliform witnessed a significant decline, Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) also remained controlled, and Turbidity & Suspended Solids were improved.",Indian,Republic World,"Prayagraj: Sangam water at Mahakumbh is safe for bathing, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) observed in its water quality report based on several parameters including pH level, Colour, Dissolved Oxygen, Temperature, Turbidity (NTU), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Fecal Coliform.
